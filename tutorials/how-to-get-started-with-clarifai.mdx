Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started with Clarifai:

## **1. Setup & Verification**

### **Step 1.1: Account Setup**

* If you already have an account, [click here](https://clarifai.com/login?utm_campaign=hack&utm_medium=REF&utm_source=lablab) to log in.


### **Step 1.2: Email Verification**

After creating an account, make sure to check your email for a verification link. Clicking on this link will redirect you to the Portal, prompting you to finish setting up your profile.


## **2. Your First AI Predictions**


### **Step 2.1: Access "my-first-application"**

Once logged in, navigate to your apps listing page. By default, you should see a pre-existing application called "my-first-application." Click on it to access its individual page.


### **Step 2.2: Upload an Image**

On the application's individual page:


1. Choose the Inputs option on the collapsible left sidebar.
2. Click on the Upload inputs button.
3. In the popup window, either upload files directly from your device or provide a publicly accessible URL. Note: Clarifai supports images, videos, and text inputs.
4. Confirm by selecting Upload inputs.


### **Step 2.3: Make a Prediction**

[After uploading](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/quick-start/your-first-predictions/?utm_campaign=hack&utm_medium=REF&utm_source=lablab), your image will be listed on the inputs manager page:

1. Click on the listed image to view it.
2. Change the page mode to Predict using the settings at the top-right.
3. On the right sidebar, select the General workflow (or any other workflow from the Community).
4. After processing, your predictions will be displayed on the right sidebar.

## **3. Creating a Custom Model**

For a more tailored experience, Clarifai allows you to [build custom models](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/quick-start/your-first-custom-model?utm_campaign=hack&utm_medium=REF&utm_source=lablab):

### **Step 3.1: Uploading Training Data**

1. Navigate to the Inputs option on the left sidebar.
2. Use the Upload inputs button to upload your training data.
3. Annotate your inputs by adding appropriate tags or keywords. For instance, if you upload an image of a dog, label it as "dog."

### **Step 3.2: Build & Train Your Model**

Select the Models option on the left sidebar.

Click on Add Model.

You have 3 options:

1. Importing the Pre-Trained Models from Clarifai Community
2. Building a Custom Model
3. Importing models from Hugging Face.


To train your own model click on Build a Custom Model

Choose the type of model, like a Transfer Learning Classifier.

Fill in the necessary details such as Model ID, Dataset ID, and select the concepts you've used for annotations (e.g., "dog" or "cat").

Click Train Model.

Once your model is trained, you can start making predictions with it.

## **4. Using Clarifai API**

If you're aiming to integrate Clarifai within your application, the API is your go-to. The [Clarifai API](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/api-overview/?utm_campaign=hack&utm_medium=REF&utm_source=lablab) allows for robust communication between your application and the platform. You can use the API to upload inputs, modify data, request information, and delete information.


* **Access**: The API is available over HTTPS at https://api.clarifai.com.
* **Clients**: While you can directly interact with the API using RESTful requests, it's recommended to use one of Clarifai's official [client libraries](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/api-overview/?api-clients/utm_campaign=hack&utm_medium=REF&utm_source=lablab) available in various programming languages.


## **5. Building a Project with Llama 2 Model**

To utilize the Llama 2 model:

1. Login to the Clarifai platform.
2. Navigate to the Community section.
3. Search and select the Llama 2 model.
4. Choose the Python API Client to integrate the model into your application.

You can find more details and a comprehensive guide in the provided video:[ Llama 2 Model Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gid9_b-neS5utcqPk06iSCgfEk3AIdrB/view?usp=share_link)

Furthermore, create a Public UI Module demo of your project and host it on the Clarifai Platform. For detailed steps, refer to the video tutorial:[ Public UI Module Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q6C6kPyyGQcs1pzeGWXTXmxfvHIvCwbg/view?usp=share_link)

## **6. Further Assistance**

For in-depth tutorials on creating workflows using the API, you can refer to pre-built educational materials shared on the event page or attend the Kickoff session.

**Happy building!** ðŸš€
