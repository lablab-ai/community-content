This tutorial shows how to create a custom diffusers pipeline for text-guided image-to-image generation with the Stable Diffusion model 
using the 🤗 Hugging Face Diffusers library.
After reading, you will be able to create beautiful AI generated Artworks from a simple sketch.

## Short introduction to Stable Diffusion 

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, 
Stability AI and LAION. It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. This model uses a 
frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, 
the model is relatively lightweight and runs on most GPUs. If you want to learn more continue

## Lets get started

```bash
!nvidia-smi
```

You need to accept the model license before downloading or using the weights. In this tutorial we'll use model version v1-4, 
so you'll need to visit [its card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4), read the license and tick the checkbox 
if you agree.

You have to be a registered user in 🤗 Hugging Face Hub, and you'll also need to use an access token for the code to work. For 
more information on access tokens, please refer [to this section of the documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).

```bash
!pip install diffusers==0.3.0 transformers ftfy
!pip install -qq "ipywidgets>=7,<8"
```

Now we will login into 🤗 Hugging Face. You can use the `notebook_login` function to login.
```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

After this we will get started with the Image2Image pipeline.
```python
import inspect
import warnings
from typing import List, Optional, Union

import torch
from torch import autocast
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

from diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline
```

Load the pipeline.
```python
device = "cuda"
model_path = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"

pipe = StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    revision="fp16", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_auth_token=True
)
pipe = pipe.to(device)
```

Download an initial image and preprocess it so we can pass it to the pipeline.

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/assets/stable-samples/img2img/sketch-mountains-input.jpg"

response = requests.get(url)
init_img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")
init_img = init_img.resize((768, 512))
init_img
```

Define the prompt and run the pipeline.

```python
prompt = "A fantasy landscape, trending on artstation"
```

Here, strength is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, that controls the amount of noise that is added to the input image. Values that approach 1.0 allow for lots of variations but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input.

```python
generator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(1024)
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt=prompt, init_image=init_img, strength=0.75, guidance_scale=7.5, generator=generator).images[0]
```

In Colab you can print out the image by just typing:
```python
image
```
And there you have it! A beautiful AI generated artwork from a simple sketch.

Futhermore, you can tune the parameters and test what work best for your usecase. As you can see, when using a lower value for strength, the generated image is more closer to the original `init_image`:
