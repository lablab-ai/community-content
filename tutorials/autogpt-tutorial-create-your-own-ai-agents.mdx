## Introduction 

Auto GPT is a tool designed to make use of powerful language models to automate tasks, making it easier for developers and users to tackle various challenges.

## Installation 

To get started with Auto GPT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Auto GPT repository. 
   ```shell
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/auto-gpt/auto-gpt.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API keys by copying the provided `.env.template` file to `.env` and filling in your OpenAI API key.

Now, you're ready to use Auto GPT for various tasks.

## Example 1: Finding Email Addresses

In this example, we'll create an assistant named "Email Finder GPT" to locate email addresses of the top 10 coding YouTubers and save them to a file.

1. Run Auto GPT with the following command:
   ```shell
   ./run.sh
   ```

2. Enter the name for your assistant and its role, like "Email Finder GPT" and "An AI designed to find the emails of the top 10 coding YouTubers and save them to a file."

3. Next, you can provide up to five individual goals, such as:
   - Find the emails of the top 10 coding YouTubers.
   - Save the emails to a file.

4. Auto GPT will start its process, involving tasks like Google searching, website browsing, and email extraction. You can approve or modify its actions as it proceeds.
after that auto_gpt will automaticly create the file you can  find it on auto_gpt work space

## Example 2: Generating Python Class Exercises <a name="example-2-generating-python-class-exercises"></a>

In this example, we'll create a coding exercise generator assistant to craft Python class exercises, including starter code, solutions, and tests.

1. Run Auto GPT in continuous mode with a limit (e.g., 30 cycles):
   ```shell
   ./run.sh -y -a 30
   ```

2. Define your assistant's role, such as "Coding Exercise Generator GPT."

3. Specify its tasks, which may include:
   - Write a text description for a Python class exercise.
   - Create starter code and save it to a file.
   - Develop solution code and save it.
   - Generate test cases and save them.
it's should look like this on your shell

Auto GPT will begin its work, providing you with coding exercises and related files.
you can now go gpt workspace where you can find the coding exercice file

you can run it with 
 ```shell
 python3 bank_account_tests.py
   ```

## Challenges and Considerations

It's essential to be aware of the following challenges and considerations when using Auto GPT:

- **Early Development**: Auto GPT is in its early stages, and you may encounter occasional bugs and issues.

- **Cost**: Running Auto GPT can be expensive, especially in continuous mode. Carefully monitor costs.

- **Limited Scope**: It's not a substitute for human developers and is best suited for simpler tasks.

## Future Potential 
Despite its current limitations, Auto GPT is an intriguing tool with the potential to improve over time. It offers various functionalities, including integrating with different APIs and expanding its capabilities.

In summary, Auto GPT is a promising tool that's worth exploring, but it's essential to use it wisely and understand its current capabilities. As it evolves, it may become even more valuable for automating tasks and simplifying development workflows.
