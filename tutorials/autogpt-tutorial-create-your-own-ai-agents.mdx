## Installation

Before we dive into creating your writing assistant, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

### Environment Choice

Choose your preferred development environment:
- **VSCode + devcontainer:** If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use a pre-configured development container. Find setup instructions in the `.devcontainer` folder.
- **Docker:** Alternatively, you can set up your environment using Docker.
- **Local Python 3.10 or Later:** If you prefer a local environment, make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed. You can find installation instructions for Python on Windows [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-python-in-windows).

### Obtain OpenAI API Key

To use AutoGPT, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Get your API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Note that you must have a paid OpenAI account for the API key to work. Make sure your OpenAI account has billing set up.

### Optional Memory Backend

Depending on your needs, you can choose an optional memory backend such as Pinecone, Milvus, Redis, or Weaviate.

### ElevenLabs Key (Optional)

If you want the AI to speak, you'll need an ElevenLabs key.

### Installation of AutoGPT

Now, let's install AutoGPT:

1. Open a command prompt (CMD), Bash, or PowerShell window. Navigate to a folder on your computer and type `CMD` in the folder path at the top, then press Enter.

2. Clone the AutoGPT repository from GitHub using Git. If you don't have Git, you can also download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/releases/latest) as a ZIP file from the bottom of the page.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded AutoGPT:

   ```bash
   cd AutoGPT
   ```


4. To set up the project, run the following command in the terminal. Follow the instructions to install the necessary dependencies and set up your GitHub access token.

   ```bash
   ./run setup
   ```<https://freeimage.host/i/JJsqN8F" alt="writer-assistant" caption="AI Agent "/>
## Creating Your Writing Assistant

Now that your environment is set up, let's create your writing assistant template. Use the following command:

```bash
./run agent create writing-assistant
```
  ```<https://freeimage.host/i/JJsVxQj" alt="writer-assistant" caption="AI Agent "/>
## Running Your Writing Assistant

To start your writing assistant, use the command:

```bash
./run agent start writing-assistant
```

This will initiate the agent on `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Logging in and Sending Tasks

Access the frontend at `http://localhost:8000/` and log in using a Google or GitHub account. You can then send tasks to your writing assistant through the interface.

### Stopping and Restarting

When needed, use Ctrl+C to end the session or use the stop command:

```bash
./run agent stop
```

This command forcefully stops the agent. You can also restart it using the start command.

## Example: Generating Writing Prompts

Now, let's use your writing assistant for inspiration, suggestions, and creative prompts. Here are some example prompts you can use:

- **Character Development:** Generate a detailed character profile for a time traveler stuck in a different era. Describe their appearance, personality, and motivations.

- **Setting Creation:** Create an enchanting setting for a fantasy novel, complete with unique geography, flora, fauna, and magical elements.

- **Conflict Generation:** Devise a central conflict for a mystery novel involving a detective who can only solve cases in their dreams. What's the most perplexing case they've encountered?

- **Dialogue Enhancement:** Provide a dialogue exchange between two characters who are old friends but are now on opposing sides of a political debate. Make the conversation emotionally charged.

- **Plot Twist Idea:** Suggest a surprising plot twist for a romance novel where the main characters discover they are long-lost siblings. How does this revelation impact their relationship?

- **Genre Mashup:** Combine two seemingly unrelated genres, such as science fiction and historical fiction. Develop a storyline that seamlessly merges elements from both genres.

- **Poetry Prompt:** Compose a short poem about the changing seasons, using vivid imagery and metaphors to capture the transitions.

- **Flash Fiction Challenge:** Challenge the writer to craft a compelling story in 100 words or less, featuring a sudden snowstorm as a central element.

- **Historical Inspiration:** Provide historical facts or events and challenge the writer to create a fictional story set during that time period. How do the characters interact with historical events?

- **Inspirational Quote:** Offer an inspirational quote related to perseverance or overcoming obstacles. Encourage the writer to build a story around the theme of resilience.

- **Character Dilemma:** Present a character with a moral dilemma. For instance, they find a wallet with a large sum of money. Should they keep it or try to return it to its owner?

- **Time Travel Adventure:** Imagine a time travel adventure where the protagonist accidentally changes a critical event in history. How do they correct the timeline?

- **Dream Sequence:** Craft a dream sequence that the writer can use to explore a character's subconscious thoughts and fears. How does this dream affect their actions in the real world?

- **Evolving Relationships:** Describe the evolution of a friendship over several decades, highlighting the key moments that strengthen or strain the bond.

- **Twisted Fairy Tale:** Reimagine a classic fairy tale with a dark twist. How does the story change when the traditional roles of heroes and villains are reversed?
