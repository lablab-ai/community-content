## What is Qdrant?

Qdrant is a high-performance search engine and database built in Rust, designed for vector similarity. It provides fast and reliable performance, even under high load, making it an ideal choice for applications that require speed and scalability. Qdrant can turn your embeddings or neural network encoders into powerful applications for various use cases, such as matching, searching, recommending, or performing other complex operations on large datasets. With its extended filtering support, it is well-suited for faceted search and semantic-based matching. The user-friendly API simplifies the process of working with Qdrant. Qdrant Cloud offers a managed solution that requires minimal setup and maintenance, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

## What will we do?

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/ship.png" />

In this tutorial we will utilize Qdrant Vector Database to store Embeddings from Cohere's model and search using cosine similarity. We will use Cohere SDK to access the model. So, without any further ado, let’s jump in!

### Prerequisites

I will use Qdrant Cloud to host my Database. And good to know, that Qdrant provides 1 GB of free forever memory. So go and use Qdrant Cloud. You can find out how to do it [here](https://lablab.ai/t/question-and-answer-on-your-data-with-qdrant#is-qdrant-worth-using).

Now let's create a new virtual environment inside project directory and install the required packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install cohere qdrant-client python-dotenv
```

Please create a project `.py` file.

### Data

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/eagle.png" />

We will store our data in JSON format. Feel free to copy it:

```json
[
  { "key": "Lion", "desc": "Majestic big cat with golden fur and a loud roar." },
  { "key": "Penguin", "desc": "Flightless bird with a tuxedo-like black and white coat." },
  { "key": "Gorilla", "desc": "Intelligent primate with muscular build and gentle nature." },
  { "key": "Elephant", "desc": "Large mammal with a long trunk and gray skin." },
  { "key": "Koala", "desc": "Cute and cuddly marsupial with fluffy ears and a big nose." },
  { "key": "Dolphin", "desc": "Playful marine mammal known for its intelligence and acrobatics." },
  {

  { "key": "Sloth", "desc": "Slow-moving mammal found in the rainforests of South America." },
  { "key": "Flamingo", "desc": "Tall, pink bird with long legs and a curved beak." }
]
```

### Environment variables

Create `.env` file and store your Cohere API key, Qdrant API key and Qdrant host there:

```bash
QDRANT_API_KEY=<qdrant-api-keu>
QDRANT_HOST=<qdrant-host>
COHERE_API_KEY=<cohere-api-key>
```

### Importing libraries

```python
import json
import os
import uuid
from typing import Dict, List

import cohere
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models
```

### Load Environment variables

```python

load_dotenv()

QDRANT_API_KEY = os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY")
QDRANT_HOST = os.getenv("QDRANT_HOST")
COHERE_API_KEY = os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY")

COHERE_SIZE_VECTOR = 4096  # Larger model

if not QDRANT_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("QDRANT_API_KEY is not set")

if not QDRANT_HOST:
    raise ValueError("QDRANT_HOST is not set")

if not COHERE_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("COHERE_API_KEY is not set")
```

### How to index data and search throught it later?

I will implement the `SearchClient` class, which will be able to index and access our data. Class will contain all necessary functionalities, such as indexing and searching, but also data conversion to necessary formats.

```python
class SearchClient:
    def __init__(
        self,
        qdrabt_api_key: str = QDRANT_API_KEY,
        qdrant_host: str = QDRANT_HOST,
        cohere_api_key: str = COHERE_API_KEY,
        collection_name: str = "animal",
    ):
        self.qdrant_client = QdrantClient(host=qdrant_host, api_key=qdrabt_api_key)
        self.collection_name = collection_name

        self.qdrant_client.recreate_collection(
            collection_name=self.collection_name,
            vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
                size=COHERE_SIZE_VECTOR, distance=models.Distance.COSINE
            ),
        )

        self.co_client = cohere.Client(api_key=cohere_api_key)

    # Qdrant requires data in float format
    def _float_vector(self, vector: List[float]):
        return list(map(float, vector))

    # Embedding using Cohere Embed model
    def _embed(self, text: str):
        return self.co_client.embed(texts=[text]).embeddings[0]

    # Prepare Qdrant Points
    def _qdrant_format(self, data: List[Dict[str, str]]):
        points = [
            models.PointStruct(
                id=uuid.uuid4().hex,
                payload={"key": point["key"], "desc": point["desc"]},
                vector=self._float_vector(self._embed(point["desc"])),
            )
            for point in data
        ]

        return points

    # Index data
    def index(self, data: List[Dict[str, str]]):
        """
        data: list of dict with keys: "key" and "desc"
        """

        points = self._qdrant_format(data)

        result = self.qdrant_client.upsert(
            collection_name=self.collection_name, points=points
        )

        return result

    # Search using text query
    def search(self, query_text: str, limit: int = 3):
        query_vector = self._embed(query_text)

        return self.qdrant_client.search(
            collection_name=self.collection_name,
            query_vector=self._float_vector(query_vector),
            limit=limit,
        )
```

### Let's use our code!

Let's try to read data from the `data.json` file, process and index it. Then we can try to search and get top 3 results from our Database!

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = SearchClient()

    # import data from data.json file
    with open("data.json", "r") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    index_result = client.index(data)
    print(index_result)

    print("====")

    search_result = client.search(
        "Tallest animal in the world, quite long neck.",
    )

    print(search_result)
```

### RESULTS!

```bash
operation_id=0 status=<UpdateStatus.COMPLETED: 'completed'>

===

[ScoredPoint(id='d17eb61c-8764-4bdb-bb26-ac66c3ffa220', version=0, score=0.8677041, payload={'desc': 'Tallest land animal with a long neck and spots on its fur.', 'key': 'Giraffe'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id='4934a842-8c55-42bc-938f-a839be2505de', version=0, score=0.71296465, payload={'desc': 'Large, semi-aquatic mammal with a wide mouth and stubby legs.', 'key': 'Hippopotamus'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id='05d7e73c-a8bf-44f9-a8b4-af82e06719d0', version=0, score=0.69240415, payload={'desc': 'Large, thick-skinned mammal with a horn on its nose.', 'key': 'Rhino'}, vector=None)]
```

As you can see in 1st row: index operation went well. We got 3 results, as we defined.
The 1st one is (as expected) a Giraffe. We also got Hippopotamus and Rhino. They are also huge, but I think Giraffe is the tallest 😆.

## I got it, and…what’s next?

To practice your Qdrant skills, I recommend building an API that will allow your application to index data, add new records and search. I think you can utilize FastAPI for that! 

And if you want to go wild with the new skills, I would recommend you to use them to build an AI based application during the Cohere x Qdrant AI Hackathon this weekend!
