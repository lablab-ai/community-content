To create an app using PaLM 2 model by Google, you will need to first install the PaLM 2 model https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/. You can do this by following the instructions on the PaLM 2 website. Once you have installed the model, you can start creating your app.

One way to create an app using PaLM 2 is to use it as a natural language processing (NLP) engine. NLP engines are used to understand and generate human language. You can use PaLM 2 to create an app that can answer your questions, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and more.

Another way to create an app using PaLM 2 is to use it as a machine learning (ML) model. ML models are used to learn from data and make predictions. You can use PaLM 2 to create an app that can detect objects in images, classify text, generate text, and more.

Here are some code samples that you can use to get started with creating an app using PaLM 2:

```
import palm2

# Create a PaLM 2 model
model = palm2.Palm2Model()

# Ask the model a question
question = "What is the capital of France?"
answer = model.generate_text(question)

# Print the answer
print(answer)
```

```
import palm2

# Create a PaLM 2 model
model = palm2.Palm2Model()

# Load an image of a cat
image = cv2.imread("cat.jpg")

# Detect objects in the image
objects = model.detect_objects(image)

# Print the objects
for object in objects:
    print(object)
```

```
import palm2

# Create a PaLM 2 model
model = palm2.Palm2Model()

# Generate text
text = model.generate_text("This is a story about a cat.")

# Print the text
print(text)
```

These are just a few examples of how you can use PaLM 2 to create apps. The possibilities are endless.
