## Introduction
[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion), is a new generative model that can generate high-resolution images with a single forward pass.
[AI21 Studio](https://www.ai21.com/studio) is a platform that provides developers and businesses with top-tier natural language processing (NLP) solutions, powered by AI21 Labs’ state-of-the-art language models.



## What we are going to do?
In this tutorial, we will build a simple and funny app, for creating engaging tweets, using AI21 Labs and cool cover images using Stable Diffusion. We will use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build our app. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.


## Prerequisites
Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and choose that compatible with your operating system and download it, or feel free to use any other code editor like: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), etc.

I recommend you to use GitHub to sign up. Later it will be helpful to depploy our app in a seconds. Click `Sign up with GitHub` button.



## Getting Started

### Create a brand new project

Open Visual Studio Code and create new folder named `ai21-sd-tutorial`:

```bash
mkdir ai21-sd-tutorial
cd ai21-sd-tutorial
```

### Create a virtual environment and activate it

Next, we need to create a virtual environment and activate it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# on MacOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# on Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```


### Install all dependencies

Now, we need to install all dependencies. To do this, open and run the following command in your terminal:


```bash

pip install streamlit
pip install ai21
pip install stability-sdk

```

### Implementing the app

Firstly, let's create a file named `stable_diffusion.py` and implement function to generate image from text using Stable Diffusion model. [Read more](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/features/text-to-image?tab=python) about Text-to-image gRPC API python client.


```python

import os
import io
import warnings
from PIL import Image
from stability_sdk import client
import stability_sdk.interfaces.gooseai.generation.generation_pb2 as generation

# Our Host URL should not be prepended with "https" nor should it have a trailing slash.
os.environ['STABILITY_HOST'] = 'grpc.stability.ai:443'

# Sign up for an account at the following link to get an API Key.
# https://dreamstudio.ai/

# Click on the following link once you have created an account to be taken to your API Key.
# https://dreamstudio.ai/account

# Paste your API Key below.


def imagine(prompt, stable_diffusion_api_key):

    try:
        output_path = ""
        # Set up our connection to the API.
        stability_api = client.StabilityInference(
            # key=os.environ.get("STABILITY_KEY"), # API Key reference.
            key=stable_diffusion_api_key, # API Key reference.
            verbose=True, # Print debug messages.
            engine="stable-diffusion-xl-beta-v2-2-2", # Set the engine to use for generation.
            # Available engines: stable-diffusion-v1 stable-diffusion-v1-5 stable-diffusion-512-v2-0 stable-diffusion-768-v2-0
            # stable-diffusion-512-v2-1 stable-diffusion-768-v2-1 stable-diffusion-xl-beta-v2-2-2 stable-inpainting-v1-0 stable-inpainting-512-v2-0
        )

        # Set up our initial generation parameters.
        answers = stability_api.generate(
            prompt=prompt, # The prompt to generate from.
            seed=992446758, # If a seed is provided, the resulting generated image will be deterministic.
                            # What this means is that as long as all generation parameters remain the same, you can always recall the same image simply by generating it again.
                            # Note: This isn't quite the case for CLIP Guided generations, which we tackle in the CLIP Guidance documentation.
            steps=30, # Amount of inference steps performed on image generation. Defaults to 30.
            cfg_scale=8.0, # Influences how strongly your generation is guided to match your prompt.
                        # Setting this value higher increases the strength in which it tries to match your prompt.
                        # Defaults to 7.0 if not specified.
            width=512, # Generation width, defaults to 512 if not included.
            height=512, # Generation height, defaults to 512 if not included.
            samples=1, # Number of images to generate, defaults to 1 if not included.
            sampler=generation.SAMPLER_K_DPMPP_2M # Choose which sampler we want to denoise our generation with.
                                                        # Defaults to k_dpmpp_2m if not specified. Clip Guidance only supports ancestral samplers.
                                                        # (Available Samplers: ddim, plms, k_euler, k_euler_ancestral, k_heun, k_dpm_2, k_dpm_2_ancestral, k_dpmpp_2s_ancestral, k_lms, k_dpmpp_2m, k_dpmpp_sde)
        )
        # Set up our warning to print to the console if the adult content classifier is tripped.
        # If adult content classifier is not tripped, save generated images.
        for resp in answers:
            for artifact in resp.artifacts:
                if artifact.finish_reason == generation.FILTER:
                    warnings.warn(
                        "Your request activated the API's safety filters and could not be processed."
                        "Please modify the prompt and try again.")                  
                if artifact.type == generation.ARTIFACT_IMAGE:
                    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(artifact.binary))
                    prompt.replace(".", "")
                    img.save(prompt[:10] + '.png') # Save our generated images with their seed number as the filename.
                    img_path = prompt[:10] + '.png'
        
        return img_path

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        return ""

```

Next, let's create a file named `ai21_studio.py` and implement function which will be used to generate cool ideas for engaging tweets to promote a brand or product:

```python

import ai21

def generate(prompt, ai21_api_key):
    ai21.api_key = ai21_api_key

    _prompt = """
    Write a tweet to promote an event for Shmolt, a food and more delivery company.
    ##
    Event: Christmas.
    Tweet: Oven broke in the last minute and you have no turkey? No need to panic, with Shmolt delivery it will be at your door step by Christmas eve!
    ##
    Event: Valentine's Day.
    Tweet: Order her roses using Shmolt, so you can have time to stop and smell the roses #Valentines
    ##
    Event: Summer Sale.
    Tweet: In this heat, why get out of the AC when you have 10% off of all Shmolt deliveries?
    ##
    Event: Mother's Day.
    Tweet:

    """
    
    response = ai21.Completion.execute(
        model="j2-mid",  # The engine to use for generation.
        prompt=_prompt + prompt,
        numResults=1,
        maxTokens=64,
        temperature=0.84,
        topKReturn=0,
        topP=1,
        countPenalty={
            "scale": 0.1,
            "applyToNumbers": False,
            "applyToPunctuations": False,
            "applyToStopwords": False,
            "applyToWhitespaces": False,
            "applyToEmojis": False
        },
        frequencyPenalty={
            "scale": 0,
            "applyToNumbers": False,
            "applyToPunctuations": False,
            "applyToStopwords": False,
            "applyToWhitespaces": False,
            "applyToEmojis": False
        },
        presencePenalty={
            "scale": 0,
            "applyToNumbers": False,
            "applyToPunctuations": False,
            "applyToStopwords": False,
            "applyToWhitespaces": False,
            "applyToEmojis": False
        },
        stopSequences=["##"]
    )

    return response['completions'][0]['data']['text']

```

Perfect! Now we have all the functions we need to generate `engaging` ideas and `cool` cover images.

Finally, Create a file named `app.py` here we will implement our logic for Streamlit app. It allows us to create really fast web apps in pure Python and share it with everyone.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HieSL7I.png" alt="Stable Diffusion" caption="Stable Diffusion" />

Let's import all the necessary libraries and functions:

```python

# Import from standard library
import os
import logging

# Import from 3rd party libraries
import streamlit as st

# Import modules from the local package
import stable_diffusion, ai21_studio

```

Basic configuration for the app:

```python

# Configure logger
logging.basicConfig(format="\n%(asctime)s\n%(message)s", level=logging.INFO, force=True)

# Configure Streamlit page and state
st.set_page_config(page_title="AI21 Studio Tutorial", page_icon="🍩")

```

Initialize the app states:

```python
# Store the initial value of widgets in session state
if "imagine" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.imagine = ""

if "img_path" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.img_path = ""

if "query" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.query = ""

if "im_query" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.im_query = ""

if "prompt_generate" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.prompt_generate = ""

if "text_error" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.text_error = ""

if "stable_diffusion_api_key" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.stable_diffusion_api_key = ""

if "ai21_api_key" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.ai21_api_key = ""

if "visibility" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.visibility = "visible"

```

Work on the app layout:


```python

# Force responsive layout for columns also on mobile
st.write(
    """
    <style>
    [data-testid="column"] {
        width: calc(50% - 1rem);
        flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem);
        min-width: calc(50% - 1rem);
    }
    </style>
    """,
    unsafe_allow_html=True,
)

```


Let's create sidebar where we can put our `API keys`. Why not simple use `.env`? Because we want to make it available for everyone to use it without any hassle. Later, we can also deploy it to Streamlit Sharing Cloud.

```python


# Render Streamlit page
with st.sidebar:
    st.session_state.cohere_api_key = st.text_input('AI21 Studio API Key', )
    st.session_state.stable_diffusion_api_key = st.text_input('Stable Diffusion API Key', )

```

Quickly add a cool `title` and `description` for the app:


```python

# title of the app
st.title("AI21 Studio + Stable Diffusion Tutorial")


st.markdown(
    "This is a demo of the AI21 Studio + Stable Diffusion Tutorial app."
)

```

Now, let's add a `st.text_area()` widget to get the `prompt` from the user and a `st.button()` widget to generate the `ideas` based on the prompt.

```python


# textarea
st.session_state.query = st.text_area(
    label="Generate engaging ideas for tweets",
    placeholder="Elon Musk wants to fight with Mu", height=100)


# button
st.button(
    label="Generate ideas",
    help="Click to genearate ideas",
    key="generate_prompt",
    type="primary",
    on_click=generate_ideas,
    )


```

Now, let's add another `st.text_area()` widget for image generation using Stable Diffusion. You may ask why we don't instantly generate the image after clicking the `Generate ideas` button along with the ideas. The reason is that we want to make it more interactive and fun. 


```python


# textarea
st.session_state.im_query = st.text_area(label="Cool description for tweets cover", placeholder="Elon Musk wants to fight with Mu", height=100)


# button
st.button(
    label="Generate image",
    help="Click to genearate image",
    key="generate_image",
    type="primary",
    on_click=imagine,
    )


```


Output genearated `ideas` and `image`:


```python

text_spinner_placeholder = st.empty()
if st.session_state.text_error:
    st.error(st.session_state.text_error)


if st.session_state.prompt_generate:
    st.markdown("""---""")
    st.text_area(label="Cool ideas", value=st.session_state.prompt_generate,)


if st.session_state.img_path:
    st.markdown("""---""")
    st.subheader("Cool image")
    st.image(st.session_state.img_path, use_column_width=True, caption="Image generated by Stable Diffusion", output_format="PNG")

```

And last but not least, it's time to implement main functions for generating `ideas`:

```python

def generate_ideas():

    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    if st.session_state.cohere_api_key == "":
        st.session_state.text_error = "Missed API key."
        return


    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    if st.session_state.file_path == "" or st.session_state.query == "":
        st.session_state.text_error = "Missed a file or query."
        return


    st.session_state.prompt_generate = ""
    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    with text_spinner_placeholder:
        with st.spinner("Please wait while we process your query..."):
            prompt = ai21_studio.generate(prompt=st.session_state.query, ai21_api_key=st.session_state.ai21_api_key)

            if prompt == "":
                st.session_state.text_error = "Your request activated the API's safety filters and could not be processed. Please modify the prompt and try again."
                logging.info(f"Text Error: {st.session_state.text_error}")
                return
            
            st.session_state.prompt_generate = (prompt)

```

and `image`:


```python

def imagine():

    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    if st.session_state.stable_diffusion_api_key == "":
        st.session_state.text_error = "Missed API key."
        return


    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    if st.session_state.im_query == "":
        st.session_state.text_error = "Missed a query."
        return

    st.session_state.imagine = ""
    st.session_state.img_path = ""
    st.session_state.text_error = ""

    with text_spinner_placeholder:
        with st.spinner("Please wait while we generate your image..."):
            im_path = stable_diffusion.imagine(prompt=st.session_state.im_query, stable_diffusion_api_key=st.session_state.stable_diffusion_api_key)

            if im_path == "":
                st.session_state.text_error = "Your request activated the API's safety filters and could not be processed. Please modify the prompt and try again."
                logging.info(f"Text Error: {st.session_state.text_error}")
                return
            
            st.session_state.img_path = (im_path)

```

Perfect! Now, we can run our app and see the result.


```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
