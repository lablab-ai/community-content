## Get Started

### Create Prompt
To create prompts tailored to your business use case, including code generation, the "Create Prompt" feature is available. To begin, simply click on the + CREATE PROMPT button, as illustrated in the image below.

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/click-create-prompt.jpg)

After clicking the **+ CREATE PROMPT** button, you will be directed to a new page. On this page, you will find various fields and parameters that can be explored further by hovering over or clicking on the **?** buttons. Additionally, the interface is accompanied by an annotated image below, offering a concise overview of its features.

You can feed your desired input text, e.g. a question, to the model. The model will then provide a response based on how you structured your prompt. The process of figuring out and designing the best input text (prompt) to get the desired response back from the model is called **Prompt Design**.

Prompt Design Methods
When designing prompts in Generative AI Studio, there are three primary methods to shape the model's response according to your desired task:

Zero-shot prompting: In this method, the Language Model (LM) is given a prompt that describes the task without any additional data specific to the task. For example, if you want the LM to answer a question, you would simply provide the prompt "What is prompt design?".

One-shot prompting: With this method, the LM is provided with a single example of the task it needs to perform. For instance, if you want the LM to write a poem, you can provide it with a single example poem.

Few-shot prompting: This method involves providing the LM with a small number of examples related to the task it needs to perform. For example, if you want the LM to write a news article, you might provide it with a few news articles to read.

Prompt Design Modes
In the Generative AI Studio interface, you will notice two tabs for prompt design modes:

FREE-FORM: This mode allows for a flexible and unrestricted approach to prompt design. It is suitable for small and experimental prompts without additional examples. This mode is particularly useful for exploring zero-shot prompting.

STRUCTURED: In this mode, a template-based approach is provided for prompt design. It enables the addition of context and multiple examples to the prompt. This mode is especially useful for one-shot and few-shot prompting methods.

Utilizing these prompt design methods and modes empowers you to tailor the generated model responses to precisely meet your unique needs and specifications.

### FREE-FORM mode

To initiate the zero-shot prompting process in the **FREE-FORM** mode, follow these steps:

1. Copy the text "What is a prompt gallery?" and paste it into the prompt input field.
2. On the right side of the page, locate and click on the **SUBMIT** button.

Upon submitting, the model will generate a detailed definition of the term "prompt gallery" in its response.

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/new-prompt-freeform.jpg)

Here are a few exploratory exercises for you to explore.
- adjust the `Token limit` parameter to `1` and click the **SUBMIT** button
- adjust the `Token limit` parameter to `1024` and click the **SUBMIT** button
- adjust the `Temperature` parameter to `0.5` and click the **SUBMIT** button
- adjust the `Temperature` parameter to `1.0` and click the **SUBMIT** button

Inspect if how the responses change as to change the parameters?

### STRUCTURED mode
By utilizing the **STRUCTURED** mode, you can design prompts in a more organized manner, allowing you to provide context and examples for effective prompt creation. This presents an excellent opportunity to explore one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques.

To proceed with this section and request the model to complete a sentence, please follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, navigate to the **Create Prompt** window and select the To proceed with the one-shot and few-shot prompting using the **STRUCTURED** mode, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are on the **STRUCTURED** tab within the Create Prompt window.
2. Copy the phrase "the colour of the sky is" and paste it into the **INPUT** field.
3. On the right side of the page, locate the **SUBMIT** button and click on it.

After submitting the prompt, you will receive a response similar to the one illustrated in the accompanying image.

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/new-prompt-structured-zero-shot.jpg)

Instead of providing a complete sentence as a response, the model generated a full sentence, which was not the intended outcome. To influence the model's response and achieve the desired completion, you can utilize the one-shot prompting technique.

To modify the prompt and incorporate an example for the model to base its output on, follow these steps:

In the Examples field, copy the phrase "the colour of the grass is" and paste it into the INPUT field.
Copy the word "green" and paste it into the OUTPUT field.
Locate the SUBMIT button on the right side of the page and click on it.
By making this adjustment, the model will now respond with the completion of the sentence as desired. The generated response should resemble something similar to the following.

Congrats! You have successfully influenced the way the model produces response.

For the next task, you will utilize the model to conduct sentiment analysis on a sentence, such as determining whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. To proceed, please follow these steps:

1. Return to the **Create Prompt** window.
2. Copy the prompt "It was a time well spent!" and paste it into the **INPUT** field.
3. On the right side of the page, locate the **SUBMIT** button and click on it.

Upon submitting the prompt, the model will perform sentiment analysis on the sentence and provide a response indicating the sentiment expressed.
![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/new-prompt-structured-sentiment-zero-shot.jpg)

As observed, the model lacked sufficient information to accurately discern that sentiment analysis was the intended task. This can be improved by presenting the model with a few examples that clarify the desired outcome.

To address this, follow the steps outlined in the image below, which demonstrates how to add examples for better prompt formulation:

1. Access the **Create Prompt** window.
2. Incorporate the provided examples, as illustrated in the image.

By including these examples, the model will be better equipped to understand and fulfill the objective of performing sentiment analysis.

| **INPUT**                         | **OUTPUT** |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| A well-made and entertaining film | positive   |
| I fell asleep after 10 minutes    | negative   |
| The movie was ok                  | neutral    |

and click on the **SUBMIT** button on the right side of the page

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/new-prompt-structured-sentiment-few-shot.jpg)

With the modifications made, the model will now respond as desired, indicating a **positive** sentiment.

To preserve the newly crafted prompt for future use, simply follow these steps:

1. Locate and click on the **SAVE** button.
2. Provide a name of your choice for the prompt.
3. Save the prompt for future reference and utilization.

By saving the prompt, you can conveniently access and reuse it whenever required.

The saved prompt will appear at the **MY PROMPTS** tab.

### Create Chat Prompt
To create a new chat prompt, navigate back to the **Language** page and locate the **+ CREATE CHAT PROMPT** button. Click on this button to initiate the process of designing a chat-based prompt..

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/click-create-chat-prompt.jpg)

You will see the new chat prompt page. It's relatively similar to the [new prompt page](#new-prompt) that you went through earlier.

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gen-ai-studio/language/prompt-gallery/new-chat-prompt.jpg)

For this section, you will add context to the chat and let the model respond based on the context provided. Let's add these contexts to the **Context** field.

- copy these context to **Context** field
>> Your name is Roy. <br/>
>> You are a support technician for an IT department. <br/>
>> You only respond with "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" to any queries.

- copy "my computer is so slow" to the chatbox and 
- press **Enter** key or click the send message button (the right arrow-head button)
