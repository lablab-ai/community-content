## What is AutoGPT

A developer named Significant Gravitas on 30/3/2023 posted on GitHub an open-source Python application, called Auto-GPT. It is using GPT-4 as its basis and allows it to act “autonomously” without the need for the user to prompt every action. 

Auto-GPT has internet access, long-term and short-term memory management, GPT-4 for text generation and file storage, and summarization with GPT-3.5, according to the GitHub post. Anything you can ask ChatGPT, like debugging code and writing an email, you can ask Auto-GPT. However, you can ask Auto-GPT to complete even more advanced tasks, with fewer prompts and it will first make a plan of achieving it and then will execute it.

AutoGPT can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks, such as research, coding, and creative writing, by assigning roles and goals and using its capability. It is accessed through a web-based interface, which allows users to view data and reports generated by the program.

We encourage you to know more about its capabilities and explore [AutoGPT app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/autogpt). 

But today we will learn how to set up our own private Auto-GPT, without any required coding skill in less than 30 minutes! So, dive in!

## Let’s start!

### Install Python and visual studio code

Go to [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the version for your OS. And install it.

Go to [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version for your OS. And install it.

### Get the Auto-GPT code

Go to GitHub for the code and download it as a zip file (press the green button). Then extract it, open Visual Studio Code, and open the extracted folder with Visual Studio Code.

### Set up API

Get your OpenAI API keys from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Go to .env.template and insert your OpenAI API key in the destined field.

### Rename .env.template

Press F2 or right-click on the .env.template and rename it to .env

And we’re ready to go!

## Let’s test it!

Go to the “terminal” tab in Visual Studio Code and let’s install our dependencies

```bash

pip install -r **requirements txt**

```

Now we can run script.

```bash

python3 scripst/main.py

```

And we’re good to go!

Name your AutoGPT, provide a goal and enjoy your private assistant!


## AutoGPT and You

As I wrote previously, the potential of AutoGPT exceeds the potential of GPT-4 or ChatGPT. Only the learning ability and access to the internet make it a powerful tool to use it in your everyday workflow.

If you want to learn more from lablab.ai’s [AutoGPT tutorial](https://lablab.ai/tech/autogpt), feel free to. We want you to grow and learn more about AI, as it is a tool to improve our work.

And if you want to build your own new application using [AutoGPT API](https://lablab.ai/tech/autogpt) we have an upcoming [AutoGPT Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/autonomous-gpt-agents-hackathon) where you can during 24 hours build a working prototype alongside with like-minded people from all around the world.
