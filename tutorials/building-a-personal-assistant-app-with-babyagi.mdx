## Introduction 
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of building a Personal Assistant App using the BabyAGI model. This app will utilize the capabilities of the BabyAGI model to perform various tasks and provide assistance to the user. 
We will integrate the app with an existing task management system to enhance its functionality. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Personal Assistant App that can answer questions and manage tasks.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
Familiarity with APIs

[BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) is AI-powered task management system. It uses OpenAI models (e.g. [GPT-4]() or [GPT-3.5]()) and Vector Database to create, prioritize and execute tasks. The system creates tasks based on previous results and user's objectives. Then it uses OpenAI models to to solve tasks and Vector Database to store and retrieve past results.

## Setting up the Development Environment

1.install Python on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.install a code editor of your choice. like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.

## Setting up the Development Environment
let's create a Python virtual environment. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:
```# Create a new directory for your project. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:
mkdir personal_assistant_app
cd personal_assistant_app

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
env\Scripts\activate.bat
# For macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

```

## installing Necessary Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install Flask and other required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install flask

```

##  Creating a Flask Application
Create a new file called app.py in the project directory and add the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Personal Assistant App'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

```

Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python app.py

```
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000

##Integrating the BabyAGI Model
we will use the OpenAI API. Make sure you have access to the OpenAI API and obtain an API key. Once you have the API key, store it securely and add the following code to your app.py
To integrate the BabyAGI model into our app, we will use the OpenAI API. Follow the steps below:

1.Make sure you have access to the OpenAI API. If you don't have an API key, obtain one from the OpenAI website and securely store it.https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat

2.Install the openai Python package by running the following command:
```bash
pip install openai

```
3.In your app.py file, import the openai module and set your API key:
```
import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def ask_babyagi(question):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine='text-davinci-003',
        prompt=question,
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```
5. Add a new route /ask to your Flask application that handles POST requests and calls the ask_babyagi function:
```
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    question = request.form['question']
    answer = ask_babyagi(question)
    return answer


```
## Implementing Task Management Functionality
To enhance the functionality of our Personal Assistant App, we will integrate it with a task management system. Follow the steps below:
1.Install the requests Python package by running the following command
```
pip install requests

```
2.Define the URL of the task management API:
```
import requests

TASK_API_URL = 'https://dummy-task-api.com/api/tasks'
```
3.Implement a function create_task that creates a new task using the task management API:
```

def create_task(title):
    payload = {'title': title}
    response = requests.post(TASK_API_URL, json=payload)
    return response.json()
```

4.Add a new route /create-task to your Flask application that handles POST requests and calls the create_task function:
```
@app.route('/create-task', methods=['POST'])
def create_task_route():
    title = request.form['title']
    task = create_task(title)
    return task
```


```
## Building the User Interface
1.Create a new file called index.html in the project directory and add the following code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Personal Assistant App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Personal Assistant App</h1>

    <h2>Ask a Question</h2>
    <form action="/ask" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="question" placeholder="Enter your question" required>
        <button type="submit">Ask</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Create a Task</h2>
    <form action="/create-task" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Enter task title" required>
        <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>


```
2.Update the home route in app.py to render the index.html template:
```
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')



```
##  Testing the Personal Assistant App

1.Start the Flask application by running the following command

```
python app.py

```
2.Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000.

3.You should see the Personal Assistant App with the ability to ask questions and create tasks.
## Conclusion 
Congratulations! You have successfully built a Personal Assistant App with BabyAGI integration. This app allows users to ask questions and get answers using the BabyAGI model.
It also provides task management functionality by integrating with an existing task management system. Feel free to explore further and enhance the app's capabilities based on your specific requirements.
