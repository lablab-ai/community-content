## Unraveling the OpenAI Codex

OpenAI Codex, a marvel in the realm of artificial intelligence, is a brainchild of OpenAI. This AI model is a wizard at interpreting natural language and responding with generated code. It's the powerhouse behind GitHub Copilot, your virtual programming assistant. Codex is an offshoot of the renowned [GPT-3](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/gpt3) model by OpenAI, specifically fine-tuned for coding applications. OpenAI has unveiled an API for [Codex](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/codex), currently in closed beta.

Dive into the world of [Codex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code) via the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), your sandbox for AI exploration.

## Embracing the GPT-3 Tutorial Concept
Imagine transforming natural language into a SQL query. That's the magic of GPT-3. Let's say you need to fetch all users above 25 years old. You simply state:

>Fetch all users above 25 years old

And voila! The model generates the corresponding SQL query:

>SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25

This capability allows SQL query generation without any SQL syntax knowledge. It's a game-changer for non-technical individuals needing to query a database. Dive into our GPT-3 tutorial and start your GPT online journey today!

## Let's get started!

Make sure you got access to Codex. If you don't have access, you can get access to the Codex waitlist here: https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/ and getting accepted usually is within a few days.
Before we write any code, you can do some testing first on the OpenAI playground: https://beta.openai.com/playground. 
I can really recommend you to do some testing first, because it will help you understand how the model works.  

First, we need to install the OpenAI Codex library:

```python
!pip install openai
```

You can find the full documentation of this library here:https://github.com/openai/openai-python

Then, we need to import the library and set the API key

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Now, we can start writing some code. We will start by creating a function that will generate a SQL query from a natural language. We will use the `openai.Completion.create` function to generate the SQL query. We will pass the following parameters:

- `engine`: The engine that will be used to generate the SQL query. We will use `davinci-codex` for this tutorial.
- `prompt`: The natural language that will be used to generate the SQL query.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that will be generated.
- `temperature`: The temperature of the model. The higher the temperature, the more random the text will be. Lower temperature results in more predictable text.
- `top_p`: The cumulative probability for top-p sampling. 1.0 means no restrictions. Lower top_p results in more random completions.
- `frequency_penalty`: The cumulative probability for top-p sampling. 1.0 means no restrictions. Lower top_p results in more random completions.
- `presence_penalty`: The cumulative probability for top-p sampling. 1.0 means no restrictions. Lower top_p results in more random completions.
- `stop`: The sequence of tokens that will stop the generation.

```python
def generate_sql_query(prompt, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.5, top_p=1.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, presence_penalty=0.0, stop=["\n"]):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="code-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=top_p,
        frequency_penalty=frequency_penalty,
        presence_penalty=presence_penalty,
        stop=stop
    )
    return response.choices[0].text
```

Now, we can test our function. We will use the following prompt:

> Get all the users that are older than 25 years old

```python
generate_sql_query("Get all the users that are older than 25 years old")
```

The model will generate the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25
```

Now we put it all together in one file and add input via the console.

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def generate_sql_query(prompt, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.5, top_p=1.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, presence_penalty=0.0):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=top_p,
        frequency_penalty=frequency_penalty,
        presence_penalty=presence_penalty,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text

prompt = input("Enter your prompt - What data do you need?: ")
print(generate_sql_query(prompt))
```

Now run the file and enter your prompt and get back the SQL query.

## Wrapping Up the GPT-3 Tutorial Journey
In this enlightening journey, we've mastered the art of generating SQL queries from natural language using OpenAI [Codex](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/codex). We've also delved into the practical use of the OpenAI Codex library.

The road to improvement is endless. You can enhance this project by integrating a database and a user-friendly web interface. To guide the model more accurately, consider adding more prompts to the request.

For precision, you could include your database schema in the prompt. For instance:

```
USER: ID (INT), NAME (VARCHAR), AGE (DATE)
POST: ID (INT), TITLE (VARCHAR), BODY (VARCHAR), USER_ID (INT)
COMMENT: ID (INT), BODY (VARCHAR), POST_ID (INT), USER_ID (INT)
```

And why not give a spin to what you;ve learned during our [AI Hackathons] and [build GPT-3 app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/openai/gpt3) in 1, 2, or just 7 days!
