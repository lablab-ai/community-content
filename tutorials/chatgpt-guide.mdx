OpenAI has recently developed a chatbot based on their GPT-3.5 technology model. This 
generative AI model has been designed to generate text with a more natural flow, giving you the 
feeling of conversing with a real person. When you type in a query, you should receive 
a response that includes several sentences or paragraphs. This is a new advancement 
in the field of automatic text-generation AI, following their previous accomplishment 
of creating the text-to-image generator DALL-E.

ChatGPT from OpenAI is easy to use. All you have to do is type in your text and you will 
receive the information. To use the tools from OpenAI, you'll need an account. If you don't 
have one, simply register with your Google or Microsoft account - it's that easy! In order to 
register for OpenAI, you must enter a phone number. After that, you can add your email address, 
either manually or from one of the available options. Finally, a confirmation number will 
be sent to you, which you must enter on the registration page to complete the setup. You
can register [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup).

## How to use ChatGPT

OpenAI's ChatGPT tool is designed to give detailed responses to any inquiry you type - from 
questions to statements. While the best results come from inputting a statement, questions 
are also accepted. For example, if you type "explain how a combustion engine works" you'll 
get a more detailed result than if you asked "how does a combustion engine work". You can also 
get more specific and request a specific number of paragraphs for an essay or a Wikipedia 
page.

ChatGPT is not foolproof, though; if there is not enough data available, it may fill in the 
gaps with incorrect information. OpenAI notes this is rare and that the tool also currently 
has “limited knowledge of world events after 2021”, since it was trained on data before the
date. It is possible that OpenAI enables, that the tool can lookup the internet for more
information, but this is disabled for now.

To ensure accuracy, you can input queries continuously until you close your browser or reset 
the thread to clear your previous requests. You can also choose to view the page in either 
dark or light mode.
