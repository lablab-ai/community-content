**IBM watsonx Assistant** is a next-generation conversational AI solution that empowers individuals and organizations to build generative AI assistants effortlessly. These assistants deliver seamless self-service experiences to customers across various devices or channels, boost employee productivity, and scale efficiently across a business.

In this guide, you will learn how to use watsonx Assistant to build and deploy an intelligent conversational AI assistant solution that simplifies tasks, improves business efficiency, and amplifies productivity.

## Before You Begin

Follow the [instructions](#step-1-setting-up-your-ibm-cloud-account) to access the IBM Cloud account provisioned to be used in
this hackathon.

Each participant is provisioned with an individual IBM Cloud account for the hackathon. Since teammates cannot be added to your account, you’ll need to collaborate offline or virtually, working on one team member’s assigned IBM Cloud account.

### Plan Limitations

The hackathon-provided IBM Cloud account is pre-configured with a watsonx Assistant Trial plan and includes necessary services to complete the hackathon. However, note the following limitations:

- **No Support for**:
  - Built-in conversational search
  - V2 API endpoints

Refer to [watsonx Assistant Trial plan limits](#watsonx-assistant-trial-plan-limitations).

IBM has also added a $100 credit on top of the free tier for pre-configured services. You’ll receive email alerts at 25%, 50%, and 80% of your credit use, with an account deactivation notice within an hour upon reaching 100%. Plan your usage wisely and back up your work regularly. Refer [IBM cloud usage tips](#ibm-cloud-account-usage-tips) and [saving your work](#save-your-work).

**Important**: Notifications are only sent when limits are reached hourly. Exhausting the credit limit within an hour may result in deactivation without a warning email.

### Usage Restrictions

- Participants are not allowed to use the provisioned hackathon IBM Cloud account services for any purposes other than to build a solution for the hackathon.
- To use any services other than the ones pre-configured in the hackathon provisioned cloud account, you will have to bring your own personal IBM Cloud account and utilize the services.

## **Step 3: Planning Your Assistant**

With your initial setup complete, it’s time to think strategically. Planning your assistant will help you build a solution that aligns with your goals and user needs.To better understand how to effectively plan your assistant, refer to [this guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-plan-assistant).

Proper planning is essential to ensure that your assistant is well-structured and meets its intended goals. Here’s how to start: Before building your assistant, plan out:

- **Initial Channel Selection**: Decide which platform or channel your assistant will operate on.
- **Domain Expertise**: Choose the primary focus (e.g., customer support, HR).
- **Tone and Language**: Set the communication style.
- **Content Source Integration**: Identify relevant content sources.
- **Handoff Strategy**: Plan how interactions will transfer to human agents if needed.

## **Step 4: Building Actions and Steps**

Once you have a plan in place, it’s time to start constructing your assistant by creating actions and steps. These form the foundation of your assistant’s interactions.

Creating actions and steps is critical to constructing a robust conversation flow. Follow these guidelines to build effectively:

- **What is an Action?**: A task or problem the assistant helps resolve, like paying a bill or tracking orders.
  <Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/9c4508ee-e5bb-4064-9bc1-439f972e1700/full" alt="Action diagram" caption="Action diagram" />
- **What is a Step?**: An interaction between the assistant and user, including clarification questions, final responses, and agent handoffs.

## IBM Cloud account usage tips

**General:**

- Collaborate with other participants to form a team and leverage your team
  members’ cloud accounts to utilize the resources effectively.
- Always save your work in regular intervals.

**watsonx.ai:**
If you have integrated watsonx.ai to enable generative AI capabilities for
your watsonx Assistant, the watsonx.ai service consumes resources by
tokens for using the foundational models available on the platform. A token
is a collection of characters that has semantic meaning for a model.
Tokenization is the process of converting the words in your prompt into
tokens. You can learn more about tokens and how they are calculated [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tokens.html?context=wx&audience=wdp).

Leverage the model parameters to set limits for token consumption and
repetitions for efficient prompting. You can learn how to work with model
parameters [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-model-parameters.html?context=wx&audience=wdp&audience=wdp).

**Note:** The focus of this hackathon is watsonx Assistant and NOT watsonx.ai.
watsonx.ai must be used only for enabling the generative AI capabilities for
your assistant and not for any other purpose. Your cloud account will be
deactivated if any suspicious watsonx.ai service utilization is noticed.
