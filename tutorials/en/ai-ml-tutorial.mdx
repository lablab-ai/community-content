# Maximizing AI Potential: Exploring the AI/ML API with AI Agents

## Introduction

Hello AI enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Tommy, and today, weâ€™re diving into a game-changing tool that opens up a whole new world of possibilities: the [**AI/ML API**](https://lablab.ai/tech/aiml-api). Imagine accessing over 200 pre-trained models for tasks like text completion, image generation, speech synthesis, and much moreâ€”all through a single API! 

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll show you how easy it is to integrate AI capabilities into your projects, optimize your workflows, and achieve faster and more efficient results. Letâ€™s jump in and discover the magic of the AI/ML API! ðŸŒŸ

## What is the AI/ML API?

The **AI/ML API** is a robust platform that allows developers to access a wide range of pre-trained models for various AI tasks such as chat, image generation, code completion, music generation, video creation, and much more. With over 200 models available, this API provides a flexible, single-entry point to integrate state-of-the-art AI capabilities into your applications. Key features include:

- **Broad Model Selection:** Access to diverse models like LLaMA, GPT, FLUX, and more.  
- **Fast Inference:** The platform is designed for low latency, ensuring rapid responses from models.  
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built on top-tier serverless infrastructure for seamless integration and scalability

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following in place:

* **Basic Knowledge of Python**: Familiarity with Python programming is essential, as we will write and execute Python scripts in Google Colab.  
* **Google Colab Account**: Ensure you have access to Google Colab for running Python code in a cloud-based environment. This tutorial will use Google Colab to demonstrate how to set up and interact with the AI/ML API.  
* **API Keys**: You'll need API keys for:  
  * **AI/ML API**: Sign up at [AI/ML API](https://aimlapi.com/app/) to get your API key, which provides access to over 200 pre-trained models.  
  * **AgentOps API** (optional): While this tutorial focuses on the AI/ML API, having an AgentOps API key will allow you to monitor and optimize the performance of your AI agents if desired. You can register at [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai/) for a key.

## Setting Up Your Environment in Google Colab

Follow these steps to get started with the AI/ML API in Google Colab. Check out my [previous tutorial](https://lablab.ai/t/crewai-multi-agent-system) if you need a primer on setting up [Crewai](https://lablab.ai/tech/crew-ai) in Google Colab.

### Step 1: Install the Required Dependencies

Start by installing the necessary packages:

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/crewAI.git@main
!pip install agentops
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Packages

Next, import the libraries needed to create and manage your agents:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from google.colab import userdata
import os
from textwrap import dedent
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

To use AI/ML API, you need to set up some environment variables. You can store your secrets in Google Colab by navigating to Secrets (A key icon seen at the sidebar)  and using the `userdata.get` method to retrieve the key set. Alternatively, replace these with your API keys directly as strings:

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('AI_ML_API_KEY')  # Replace with 'your_api_key' if not using userdata
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo'
os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "https://api.aimlapi.com"
```

### Step 4: Initialize AgentOps

[**AgentOps**](https://lablab.ai/tech/agentops) is a platform to monitor and optimize the performance of your agents. It helps you gain insights into how efficiently your models are running and refine your approach to make the most of them.

```python
import agentops
agentops.init(userdata.get('AGENTOPS_API_KEY'), default_tags=["ai/ml"])  # Replace with your AgentsOps API key
```

## Designing the Agents and Tasks

Here's how we design our agents and tasks:

* **Research Agent**: Gathers information on a given topic.  
* **Blog Writer Agent**: Writes a blog post in a specified language based on the research.

**Note**: During my initial tests, I encountered errors while running the crew because the `verbose` parameter was incorrectly set to `2` (from a previous setup). The updated version tailored for AgentOps requires a boolean (`True` or `False`). Setting it to `True` resolved the issues.

```python
research_agent = Agent(
    role='Research Agent',
    goal='Be Exceptional at retrieving relevant blog information on {topic}.',
    verbose=True,
    backstory="You are a skilled researcher capable of parsing data research.",
    allow_delegation=False,
)

blog_writer_agent = Agent(
    role='Blog Writer',
    goal='Be Spectacular at composing detailed blog post in {language} based on research data.',
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "You are an Exceptional multilingual Blog writer capable of composing insightful articles in different languages."
    ),
    allow_delegation=False,
)
```

## Executing Tasks with Crewai

We define our tasks for each agent to perform and combine them into a crew:

```python
research_task = Task(
    description="Get information on {topic} based on your knowledge. Summarize the findings for the Blog Writer to use.",
    expected_output="A concise summary of the relevant content provided.",
    agent=research_agent,
)

blog_writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a detailed blog post on {topic} in {language} based on the summary from the Research Agent.",
    expected_output="A well-detailed blog post in {language}.",
    agent=blog_writer_agent,
    output_file="response.md",
)

blog_creation_crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, blog_writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, blog_writing_task],
    verbose=True,  # Correct usage for AgentOps compatibility
    memory=True,
)

inputs = {'topic': 'AI in Education', 'language': 'Spanish'}
result = blog_creation_crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)
agentops.end_session("Success")
```

## Output from the Blog Writer Agent

Below is the output generated by the **Blog Writer Agent** using the **"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo"** model from the **AI/ML API**. The response demonstrates the agent's ability to create a detailed and contextually accurate blog post in Spanish about the impact of AI in education.

This output showcases how effectively the **AI/ML API** can be utilized to produce high-quality multilingual content, automating the content creation process for various applications, including blogs, articles, and more.

## Measuring Performance with AgentOps

Now Let's take a closer look at the performance results for our AI agents using the **"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo"** model.

### Session Replay Analysis

1. **Research Agent Performance**:  
   * The **Research Agent** was tasked with gathering information on the topic and summarizing the findings. The session replay indicates that the agent's total task duration was approximately **11.31 seconds**. The model utilized (LLaMA 3.1-405B) performed well, with a rapid response time for generating the necessary data.  
   * The time between the start and end (from **2m 31s to 2m 42s**) suggests that the model efficiently handled the research task, processing, and returning results in a timely manner. However, small gaps in the timeline might indicate moments where the model paused, potentially for data processing or waiting for external inputs.

2. **Blog Writer Agent Performance**:  
   * The **Blog Writer Agent** had a similar duration of around **9.20 seconds** to generate a detailed blog post based on the research provided by the first agent. This quick turnaround is a testament to the model's optimized performance, leveraging the AI/ML APIâ€™s capabilities.  
   * Observing the session replay, the LLM (Large Language Model) tasks are marked in green, showing active engagement throughout the process, while the yellow segment represents tool usage, indicating possible interactions with external resources or formatting tasks to structure the final blog output.

### Key Takeaways

**Efficiency Gains**: Both agents demonstrated quick response times, with LLM calls completing in under 12 seconds. This showcases the effectiveness of using AI/ML pre-trained models through the API for achieving fast and efficient results.

**Optimization Opportunities**: By monitoring these sessions, you can identify areas for further optimization, such as refining prompts or reducing unnecessary tool usage to cut down task times.

**Cost-Effective Performance**: The AI/ML API allows you to access high-performance models like LLaMA 3.1-405B without the overhead costs associated with hosting these models locally, providing both speed and cost efficiency.
