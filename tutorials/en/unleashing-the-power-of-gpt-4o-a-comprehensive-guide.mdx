## Coding the Chatbot Application

Now, let's break down the code needed to build our chatbot application using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. We'll go through each function and explain its role in the overall application.

### Importing Necessary Libraries

We start by importing the required libraries:

```python
import streamlit as st
from openai import OpenAI
import dotenv
import os
from PIL import Image
from audio_recorder_streamlit import audio_recorder
import base64
from io import BytesIO

dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

Here, we import `streamlit` to create our web interface, and `OpenAI` to interact with OpenAI's API. We also use `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file, and `os` for interacting with the operating system. The `PIL` library is used for image processing, while `audio_recorder_streamlit` allows us to record audio within our Streamlit app. The `base64` module helps with encoding and decoding data, and `io` provides core tools for working with streams.

### Function to Query and Stream the Response from the LLM

This function interacts with the GPT-4o model to generate responses in real-time. It streams the response in chunks to provide a seamless user experience:

```python
def stream_llm_response(client, model_params):
    response_message = ""

    for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_params["model"] if "model" in model_params else "gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
        messages=st.session_state.messages,
        temperature=(
            model_params["temperature"] if "temperature" in model_params else 0.3
        ),
        max_tokens=4096,
        stream=True,
    ):
        response_message += (
            chunk.choices[0].delta.content if chunk.choices[0].delta.content else ""
        )
        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content if chunk.choices[0].delta.content else ""

    st.session_state.messages.append(
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": response_message,
                }
            ],
        }
    )

```

The `stream_llm_response` function sends a chat completion request to the OpenAI model. It accumulates the response in a variable called `response_message`. Using the `client.chat.completions.create()` method, the function calls the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response is streamed in chunks, which ensures that the user gets real-time updates. Finally, the function stores the conversation history in `st.session_state.messages`.

### Function to Convert Image to Base64

This function converts an image to a base64-encoded string, making it easy to transmit image data:

```python
def get_image_base64(image_raw):
    buffered = BytesIO()
    image_raw.save(buffered, format=image_raw.format)
    img_byte = buffered.getvalue()

    return base64.b64encode(img_byte).decode("utf-8")


```

In the `get_image_base64` function, we first create a `BytesIO` object to hold the image data. The image is saved to this buffer using the `image_raw.save()` method. We then retrieve the byte data from the buffer with `buffered.getvalue()` and encode it to base64 using `base64.b64encode()`. This function is useful for handling image uploads in our application.

---

### Main Function

The main function sets up the Streamlit app, handles user interactions, and integrates all the functionalities. It includes configuration settings, UI elements, and logic for interacting with the GPT-4o model:

```python
def main():
    # --- Page Config ---
    st.set_page_config(
        page_title="GPT-4o Chatbot Experience",
        page_icon="🤖",
        layout="centered",
        initial_sidebar_state="expanded",
    )
```

First, we configure the page using `st.set_page_config`, setting the title, icon, layout, and initial sidebar state. This ensures that our application looks professional and is easy to navigate.

```python
    # --- Header ---
    st.markdown(
        """
        <div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">
            <h1 style="color: #4CAF50;">🌟 The Ultimate GPT-4o Chatbot Experience 🌟</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #888;">Unleash the power of AI with our advanced assistant!</p>
        </div>
        """,
        unsafe_allow_html=True,
    )

```

Next, we create a header for our application using `st.html`. This displays a title and a subtitle in a visually appealing way.

```python
    # --- Side Bar ---
    with st.sidebar:
        default_openai_api_key = (
            os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
            if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None
            else ""
        )
        with st.popover("🔐 OpenAI API Key"):
            openai_api_key = st.text_input(
                "Paste your OpenAI API Key (https://platform.openai.com/)",
                value=default_openai_api_key,
                type="password",
            )
```

In the sidebar, we prompt the user to enter their OpenAI API key. We use `os.getenv` to check if an API key is already set in the environment variables. If not, we provide an input box for the user to enter their API key.

```python
    # --- Main Content ---
    if openai_api_key == "" or openai_api_key is None or "sk-" not in openai_api_key:
        st.write("#")
        st.warning(
            "⬅️ Please introduce your OpenAI API Key (make sure to have funds) to continue..."
        )

        with st.sidebar:
            st.write("#")
            st.write("#")

```

If the API key is missing or invalid, we display a warning message and provide additional resources for the user to get their API key.

```python
    else:
        client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)

        if "messages" not in st.session_state:
            st.session_state.messages = []
```

If a valid API key is provided, we initialize the OpenAI client with this key. We also check if there are any previous messages stored in `st.session_state.messages`. If not, we initialize an empty list for storing the messages.

```python
        for message in st.session_state.messages:
            with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
                for content in message["content"]:
                    if content["type"] == "text":
                        st.write(content["text"])
                    elif content["type"] == "image_url":
                        st.image(content["image_url"]["url"])
```

We then loop through any existing messages and display them using `st.chat_message`. This ensures that the conversation history is preserved and displayed to the user.

```python
        with st.sidebar:

            st.divider()

            model = st.selectbox(
                "Select a model:",
                [
                    "gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
                    "gpt-4-turbo",
                ],
                index=0,
            )

            with st.popover("⚙️ Model parameters"):
                model_temp = st.slider(
                    "Temperature", min_value=0.0, max_value=2.0, value=0.3, step=0.1
                )

            audio_response = st.toggle("Audio response", value=False)
            if audio_response:
                cols = st.columns(2)
                with cols[0]:
                    tts_voice = st.selectbox(
                        "Select a voice:",
                        ["alloy", "echo", "fable", "onyx", "nova", "shimmer"],
                    )
                with cols[1]:
                    tts_model = st.selectbox(
                        "Select a model:", ["tts-1", "tts-1-hd"], index=1
                    )

            model_params = {
                "model": model,
                "temperature": model_temp,
            }
```

In the sidebar, we provide options for the user to select the model and adjust the model parameters such as temperature. We also offer the option to enable audio responses. If audio responses are enabled, we provide additional settings for selecting the voice and model for text-to-speech conversion.

```python
            def reset_conversation():
                if (
                    "messages" in st.session_state
                    and len(st.session_state.messages) > 0
                ):
                    st.session_state.pop("messages", None)

            st.button(
                "🗑️ Reset conversation",
                on_click=reset_conversation,
            )

            st.divider()
```

We define a `reset_conversation` function to clear the conversation history. This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Reset conversation" button.

```python
            if model in ["gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "gpt-4-turbo"]:

                st.write("### **🖼️ Add an image:**")

                def add_image_to_messages():
                    if st.session_state.uploaded_img or (
                        "camera_img" in st.session_state and st.session_state.camera_img
                    ):
                        img_type = (
                            st.session_state.uploaded_img.type
                            if st.session_state.uploaded_img
                            else "image/jpeg"
                        )
                        raw_img = Image.open(
                            st.session_state.uploaded_img or st.session_state.camera_img
                        )
                        img = get_image_base64(raw_img)
                        st.session_state.messages.append(
                            {
                                "role": "user",
                                "content": [
                                    {
                                        "type": "image_url",
                                        "image_url": {
                                            "url": f"data:{img_type};base64,{img}"
                                        },
                                    }
                                ],
                            }
                        )

                cols_img = st.columns(2)

                with cols_img[0]:
                    with st.popover("📁 Upload"):
                        st.file_uploader(
                            "Upload an image",
                            type=["png", "jpg", "jpeg"],
                            accept_multiple_files=False,
                            key="uploaded_img",
                            on_change=add_image_to_messages,
                        )

                with cols_img[1]:
                    with st.popover("📸 Camera"):
                        activate_camera = st.checkbox("Activate camera")
                        if activate_camera:
                            st.camera_input(
                                "Take a picture",
                                key="camera_img",
                                on_change=add_image_to_messages,
                            )
```

For image uploads, we provide options for the user to upload an image file or take a picture using their camera. The uploaded or captured image is then converted to a base64 string and added to the conversation.

```python
            st.write("#")
            st.write("### **🎤 Add an audio:**")

            audio_prompt = None
            if "prev_speech_hash" not in st.session_state:
                st.session_state.prev_speech_hash = None

            speech_input = audio_recorder(
                "Press to talk:",
                icon_size="3x",
                neutral_color="#6ca395",
            )
            if speech_input and st.session_state.prev_speech_hash != hash(speech_input):
                st.session_state.prev_speech_hash = hash(speech_input)
                transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
                    model="whisper-1",
                    file=("audio.wav", speech_input),
                )

                audio_prompt = transcript.text

            st.divider()
```

For audio inputs, we use `audio_recorder` to record the user's speech. The recorded audio is then transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model, and the transcription is added to the conversation as a prompt.

```python
        if prompt := st.chat_input("Hi! I am the latest omnimodel from OpenAI , ask me anything! ") or audio_prompt:
            st.session_state.messages.append(
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "text",
                            "text": prompt or audio_prompt,
                        }
                    ],
                }
            )

            with st.chat_message("user"):
                st.markdown(prompt)

            with st.chat_message("assistant"):
                st.write_stream(stream_llm_response(client, model_params))

            if audio_response:
                response = client.audio.speech.create(
                    model=tts_model,
                    voice=tts_voice,
                    input=st.session_state.messages[-1]["content"][0]["text"],
                )
                audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(response.content).decode("utf-8")
                audio_html = f"""
                <audio controls autoplay>
                    <source src="data:audio/wav;base64,{audio_base64}" type="audio/mp3">
                </audio>
                """
                st.html(audio_html)
```

Finally, we handle the user input through a chat input box. The user's message or the transcribed audio prompt is added to the conversation and displayed. The assistant's response is generated using the `stream_llm_response` function and displayed in real-time. If audio responses are enabled, the response is also converted to speech and played back to the

user.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `main` function is called when the script is executed. By following these steps, we can build a fully functional chatbot application using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. This application can handle text and audio inputs, display images, and provide real-time responses, making it a powerful tool for various conversational AI applications.

To test the project run:
```bash
streamlit run <your_filename.py>
```

For example if I created a `main.py` file, the command would be:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
