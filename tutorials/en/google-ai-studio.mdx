## 🌟 Main Features of Google AI Studio

Google AI Studio offers three main ways to experiment with prompts and fine-tune models, with seamless integration to save experiments in your Google Drive.

### 1. Create a New Prompt

Let's start with the prompt creation page, which is the playground for your imagination! You can choose from three types of prompts:

#### **Chat Prompt**
Simulate back-and-forth conversations with models in a chat interface. The options include:
- System prompt definition
- Model selection (Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Pro, or fine-tuned models)
- Temperature and top-P parameters (not available for Gemini 1.5)
- JSON format response option
- Adjust safety settings (e.g., harassment, hate, explicit content)

The safety settings are particularly cool, allowing you to block categories of sensitive content ranging from "Block None" to "Block Most." This feature is crucial for regulating potentially dangerous prompts that could lead to undesirable behavior in your application.

Unlike other popular playground-like platforms, which enforce strict content restrictions by default and don't allow any flexibility, Google AI Studio gives you the freedom to customize and fine-tune these safety settings according to your needs. Whether you want to block specific content entirely or relax restrictions for testing purposes, having this level of control makes Google AI Studio incredibly versatile and user-friendly.


![Chat Prompt Example](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/b84cec44-0621-4572-7134-2192321be700/full)

> **Note:** Using Gemini 1.5 Pro, you can insert images, videos, audio, and files, which the model can interpret. For instance, ask questions about different parts of an image or analyze video content. I had a blast using this feature!

#### **Freeform Prompt**
Got a creative idea and want to see how the model handles it? The Freeform prompt option lets you write a prompt (with support for media insertion for Gemini 1.5 Pro) and then lets the model auto-continue. 

This feature is perfect for creative text generation, storytelling, and even interactive fiction! I've experimented with writing short stories and brainstorming blog topics using this prompt type, and it's incredibly versatile.

![Freeform Prompt Example](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/a9ea159a-aefa-4a6f-ae95-003b2dc1ab00/full)

#### **Structured Prompt**
Want to give your model more direction? The structured prompt feature is your best bet. It allows you to create complex prompts in a tabular form, providing the model with a few-shot example set using input/output pairs.

This approach is fantastic for tasks like classification (e.g., categorizing user reviews) or predicting sentiment. It's like a trial run before fine-tuning, helping you gauge the model's behavior with up to 500 examples. If fine-tuning feels like overkill, this prompt form can keep the few-shot examples within the structure.

### 2. Tune Models

**Model Tuning** is where Google AI Studio really shines. You can refine a model using structured prompts and import datasets via CSV files or Google Sheets directly from your Drive.

Before training starts, you can set advanced settings like:
- **Epochs:** Number of times the dataset is used (default: 5). A higher number means the model will learn more from your data but could lead to overfitting if too high.
- **Learning Rate Multiplier:** Affects how quickly the model adapts (default: 1). Too high a rate might lead to unstable training, while too low may result in slow learning.
- **Batch Size:** Number of samples per gradient update (default: 4). Larger batches can lead to faster training but require more memory.

![Model Tuning Example](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/661df468-a810-4c57-fa81-88f4658fe500/full) 

After training, you can review performance metrics specifically loss per epoch. Once tuning is complete, your model will be available for use in Freeform and Structured Prompts.

In my experience, tuning models with a few dozen examples drastically improved the output quality for my use cases, like sentiment analysis and classification tasks.

### 3. 🖼️ Prompt Gallery
Not sure where to start? The **Prompt Gallery** is your friend! This is a treasure trove of pre-set prompts that you can use to kickstart your experiments. With just a few clicks, you'll have ready-made prompts covering various tasks and domains.

![Prompt Gallery Example](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/4f7a32a6-3b77-4fba-a855-b723a5475000/full) 

### 🔍 The Coolest Feature: "Get Code" Button



![Get Code Button](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/1e368ae5-5bee-4893-bb8d-8ee7edd6d000/full)

> 🗒️ **Fun Fact:** You can see in this image how some warnings are displayed in the model output. When clicked these are labelled as: "Probability of Unsafe Content - Sexually Explicit - Warning: Medium." Interestingly, nothing in the model's output seems to fall within this category, suggesting that the model is either extra careful or freely issues these warnings even when not entirely applicable. It's a helpful feature, providing insight into how the model evaluates safety.

At the top right of each prompt interface is the **"Get Code"** button. When you click it, you'll receive the full configuration of your prompt, including all settings, system prompts, chat history, or examples, depending on the prompt type. 

And it's all in code, ready to be added to your project in any of the following languages:

- **cURL**
- **JavaScript**
- **Python**
- **Android Kotlin**
- **Swift**

I found this feature incredibly useful, as it allows you to seamlessly transition from experimentation to implementation. It makes sharing your prompts with other developers or replicating them in your projects super easy.


## 📚 The Gemini Cookbook
The [**Gemini Cookbook**](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) is a collection of guides and examples for the Gemini API. It includes quickstart tutorials for writing prompts, exploring different features, and examples of applications you can build.

### Examples:
