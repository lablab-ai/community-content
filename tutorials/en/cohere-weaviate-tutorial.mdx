## 2. Set Up and Installation Showcase

### Create an environment

Create a project folder and a `.venv` folder within:

```bash

mkdir cohere-weaviate-tutorial
cd cohere-weaviate-tutorial

// On MacOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv

// On Windows
py -3 -m venv .venv
```


### Activate the environment
Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

```bash
// On MacOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

// On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```


### Setting Up Cohere Coral
Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Cohere:

## 4. Building a Basic Application

### Application Structure
We'll create a Flask-based web application that uses Cohere Coral for processing user queries and Weaviate for semantic data retrieval.

#### Flask Setup
Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:

- **Install Flask application**:
```bash
pip install Flask
```

Set up a basic Flask application.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello World!'
```

#### Cohere Integration
Implement Cohere Coral for query processing.

```python
@app.route('/api/query', methods=['POST'])
def response():
    data = request.json
    query = data.get('query')
    
    response = co.embed(
        texts=[query], 
        model='embed-english-v3.0', 
        input_type='search_query'
    )

    embedding = response.embeddings[0]
```


#### Connect to Weaviate

Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:

- **Install Weaviate client library**:

```bash
// Python (v4)
pip install --pre "weaviate-client==4.*"

// Python (v3)
pip install "weaviate-client==3.*"
```

#### Create a Weaviate instance. 
Create a free sandbox instance on [Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). 
Go to [Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), sing in and create a new sandbox instance.
For more details, feel free refer to the WCS [Quickstart guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart).

```python
import weaviate

auth_config = weaviate.AuthApiKey(api_key="YOUR-WEAVIATE-API-KEY")

client = weaviate.Client(
  url="YOUR-WEAVIATE-SANDBOX-URL",
  auth_client_secret=auth_config,
  additional_headers={
        "X-Cohere-Api-Key": "YOUR-COHERE-API-KEY"
    }
)
```


#### Semantic Search with Weaviate
Use Cohere embeddings for a Weaviate semantic search. Specifying `custom vectors` (embeddings) (i.e. generated outside of Weaviate).

```python
result = (
    client.query
    .get("Your_Class_Name", ["fields"])
    .with_near_vector({"vector": embedding, "certainty": 0.7})
    .with_limit(10)
    .do()
)

```


#### Formatting Results
Format and return the search results.

```python
message = {'results': []}
for d in result['data']['Get']['Your_Class_Name_Here']:
    message['results'].append({
        'title': d['field1'],
        'snippet': d['field2'],
    })

resp = jsonify(message)
resp.status_code = 200
return resp
```


#### Add a Main Function
Add a main function to run the application.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()  # Optional: You may set port and host.
```


#### Run the Application
Run the application. Here is `main`: the name of the file.

```bash
flask --app main run
```
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the application in action.


### Bonus: Let's go through the basics of Weaviate

#### Create a class

```python
if client.schema.exists("Question"):
    client.schema.delete_class("Question")

class_obj = {
    "class": "Question",
    "vectorizer": "text2vec-cohere",
    "moduleConfig": {
        "text2vec-cohere": {},
        "generative-cohere": {}
    }
}

client.schema.create_class(class_obj)
```

#### Add objects
We'll add objects to our Weaviate instance using a batch import process. For this tutorial we'll go with [this dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json).
You can also try a larger, [1K row](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databyjp/wv_demo_uploader/main/weaviate_datasets/data/jeopardy_1k.json) version of the Jeopardy Dataset, or this tiny set of [50 wine reviews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databyjp/wv_demo_uploader/main/weaviate_datasets/data/winemag_tiny.csv).

```python
import requests

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json'  # replace with your desired dataset
resp = requests.get(url)

# Load data
data = json.loads(resp.text)

# Configuring a batch process
with client.batch(batch_size=100) as batch:
    # Batch import all Questions
    for i, d in enumerate(data):
        print(f"importing question: {i+1}")

        properties = {
            "answer": d["Answer"],
            "question": d["Question"],
            "category": d["Category"],
        }

        client.batch.add_data_object(
            properties,
            "Question",
        )
```

Next, do same thing but with a custom vector. Specify `custom vectors` (embeddings) (i.e. generated outside of Weaviate)

```python
import requests

file_name = "jeopardy_tiny_with_vectors_all-OpenAI-ada-002.json"  # This file includes pre-generated vectors
url = f'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/{file_name}'
resp = requests.get(url)

# Load data
data = json.loads(resp.text)

# Configuring a batch process
with client.batch(batch_size=100) as batch:
    # Batch import all Questions
    for i, d in enumerate(data):
        print(f"importing question: {i+1}")

        properties = {
            "answer": d["Answer"],
            "question": d["Question"],
            "category": d["Category"],
        }

        custom_vector = d["vector"]
        client.batch.add_data_object(
            properties,
            "Question",
            vector=custom_vector  # Adding custom vector
        )
```


#### Semantic Search with Weaviate

##### Default Semantic search
Let's try a similarity search. We'll use nearText search to look for quiz objects most similar to `biology`.

```python
nearText = {"concepts": ["biology"]}

response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question", ["question", "answer", "category"])
    .with_near_text(nearText)
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)

print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
```

You should see the following results:

```bash
{
    "data": {
        "Get": {
            "Question": [
                {
                    "answer": "DNA",
                    "category": "SCIENCE",
                    "question": "In 1953 Watson & Crick built a model of the molecular structure of this, the gene-carrying substance"
                },
                {
                    "answer": "species",
                    "category": "SCIENCE",
                    "question": "2000 news: the Gunnison sage grouse isn't just another northern sage grouse, but a new one of this classification"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```


##### Semantic search with a filter
You can add a Boolean filter to your example. For example, let's run the same search, but only look in objects that have a `category` value of `ANIMALS`.

```python
nearText = {"concepts": ["biology"]}

response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question", ["question", "answer", "category"])
    .with_near_text(nearText)
    .with_where({
        "path": ["category"],
        "operator": "Equal",
        "valueText": "ANIMALS"
    })
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)

print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
```

You should see the following results:

```bash
{
    "data": {
        "Get": {
            "Question": [
                {
                    "answer": "the nose or snout",
                    "category": "ANIMALS",
                    "question": "The gavial looks very much like a crocodile except for this bodily feature"
                },
                {
                    "answer": "Elephant",
                    "category": "ANIMALS",
                    "question": "It's the only living mammal in the order Proboseidea"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

##### Generative search `(grouped task)`
Next, we will use a grouped task prompt instead to combine all search results and send them to the LLM with specific prompt. We will ask the LLM to write a tweet about all of these search results.

```python
response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question", ["question", "answer", "category"])
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["biology"]})
    .with_generate(grouped_task="Write a tweet with emojis about these facts.")
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)

print(response["data"]["Get"]["Question"][0]["_additional"]["generate"]["groupedResult"])
```

```bash
🧬 Did you know? In 1953, Watson & Crick 🧪 built a model of the molecular structure of DNA, the gene-carrying substance! 🧬 #ScienceFacts 🐦🌿 Exciting news! In 2000, a new species 🆕 of sage grouse, the Gunnison sage grouse, was discovered. It's not just another northern sage grouse, but a unique classification! 🦆🌿 #ScienceDiscoveries
```


Generative search sends retrieved data from `Weaviate` to a `Large Language Model (LLM)`. This allows you to go beyond simple data retrieval, but transform the data into a more useful form, without ever leaving `Weaviate`.
