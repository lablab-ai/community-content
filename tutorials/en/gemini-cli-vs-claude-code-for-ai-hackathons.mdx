## Introduction

The consensus is clear: developers **love Claude Code for its precision and reasoning**. But what if I told you that for critical, real-world tasks—like **understanding a massive legacy codebase** overnight—another tool is not just better, but in a different league? Let's put both tools through their paces on the [psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) repository and build a decision framework you can use today.

The result is a crystal-clear map of **when to use which tool, and why**.

### What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, we'll compare Gemini CLI and Claude Code across four real-world challenges:

- **Challenge 1**: Mapping a large codebase (50k+ lines)
- **Challenge 2**: Performing project-wide audits
- **Challenge 3**: Handling knowledge gaps with external sources
- **Challenge 4**: Executing autonomous development tasks

By the end, you'll have a strategic decision framework to choose the right tool for each scenario.

## Discussion

### Challenge 1: Mapping the Territory, "What the hell is this codebase?"

We tasked both tools with understanding the 50k+ line requests library. And there was a big difference in the output quality. Here's what I discovered:

#### Gemini CLI: The Aerial Survey

With its **1M+ token context**, Gemini ingested the **entire repository—source**, config, and docs—in one go. In under 15 seconds, it returned a structured JSON report explaining the library's four-layer architecture, pinpointing the critical ``Session``/``Adapter`` split, and listing key dependencies.

It didn't just read the code; it executed a planned investigation using a ``codebase_investigator`` agent, tracing its own steps. For a developer facing a new codebase, this is an intelligence goldmine delivered instantly.

#### Claude Code: The Walking Tour

Claude's approach was methodical and collaborative. It started with the README, showed me the directory structure, and summarized the public API from ``__init__.py``. Its output was helpful and accurate, but it was a starting point for a conversation.

To build the same comprehensive understanding, I had to act as a guide: "Now look at ``sessions.py``," "Now explain ``adapters.py``." This dialogue is excellent for learning, but it's a slower path to a complete map.

#### The Verdict

- **For the "I need the full picture NOW" scenario** (due diligence, security audit, pre-refactor analysis), **Gemini CLI is unmatched**. Its massive context window isn't a spec sheet bullet point; it's a transformative capability that changes how you onboard.
- Claude Code wins when you want a thoughtful pair programmer to explore with you, not when you need an immediate, autonomous report.

### Challenge 2: The Project-Wide Audit

We asked both tools to perform a simple audit: "Find all user-configurable timeout settings."

#### Gemini CLI: The Compliance Officer

Gemini executed a lightning-fast text search across all files, filtered the 131 matches down to the relevant user-facing parameters, and presented a clean, 7-row table in about 10 seconds. It gave me exactly what I asked for: a checklist with no extra commentary.

This is the ideal output when you're performing a security review, writing documentation, or need a scoped answer fast.

#### Claude Code: The Systems Architect

Claude took a different path. Instead of just finding the settings, it spent a minute exploring the code to understand the entire timeout system. Its response was a mini-tutorial: it explained the three timeout formats, traced the parameter's flow through the API, Session, and Adapter layers, warned about the dangerous default of ``None``, and mapped out the exception hierarchy.

This is the ideal output when you're learning a new codebase or designing a feature that interacts with this system.

#### The Verdict

- **For audits, searches, and data extraction tasks, Gemini CLI is your precision tool**. Its ability to scan everything and return a scoped answer is unmatched for efficiency.
- **For developing a deep, contextual understanding of a system, Claude Code is your guide**. Its exploratory approach and explanatory strength turn a simple query into a learning session.

### Challenge 3: The Knowledge Gap Test

We asked both tools to summarize release notes for a version (``2.32.5``) released after their training data.

#### Claude Code: The Codebase Detective

Claude didn't know the answer from memory. Instead, it executed a flawless investigation _within the repository_: It checked the version file, searched for changelogs, found ``HISTORY.md``, and synthesized a detailed report. It provided crucial context about the reverted SSL caching feature and the version's place in the release lineage. It found truth _locally_.

#### Gemini CLI: The Web Integrator

Gemini, using its MCP server for Google Search, fetched information from the web. Its summary was accurate but brief. Interestingly, it noted the web results matched the local ``HISTORY.md``, revealing its dual awareness.

For questions about a library's broader ecosystem, recent CVEs not documented locally, or alternative solutions from forums, this live web access is a decisive advantage.

#### The Verdict: A Question of Source

- **For questions where the definitive answer lies within your project's own files, Claude Code's investigative approach is superior**. It treats your codebase as the primary source.
- **For questions about the wider world—new CVEs, latest blog posts, or APIs changed after your last commit, Gemini CLI's MCP-powered web search is your only option**. It connects your development environment to the live internet.

### Challenge 4: The Grunt Work ("Just get it done.")

This was the most revealing test. We gave both the same, straightforward task: "**Add comprehensive type hints to** ``src/requests/utils.py``."

#### Gemini CLI: The Automated Engineer

Gemini treated this as a linear engineering task: **Read → Analyze → Write → Verify**. Its killer move? After writing the file, it **automatically ran** ``python -m py_compile``. It found syntax errors, fixed them, re-ran the check, and iterated until it delivered a **working, syntactically valid file**.

The entire process required **zero intervention**. It's a **CI/CD pipeline in a CLI**.

#### Claude Code: The Collaborative Thinker

Claude analyzed the file and prepared a complete version with type hints. However, when it tried to write, it hit a critical error: "File has been unexpectedly modified." It detected Gemini's concurrent edits, attempted recovery, and ultimately **output the proposed code as a text block in our chat**. It **never wrote or verified a working file**. It was blocked by the very state change it couldn't control.

#### The Pivotal Insight: Autonomous vs. Collaborative Execution

This isn't about speed. It's about **execution model**.

- **Gemini CLI** operates like an **autonomous agent**. It assumes control, performs actions, verifies results, and iterates. It's built for **task completion**.
- **Claude Code** operates like a **pair programmer in a shared terminal**. It assumes a single-threaded, collaborative environment. When external state changed, it stopped and reported, expecting human guidance. It's built for **interactive, controlled development**.

#### The Verdict

- **For autonomous, verified batch tasks** (boilerplate generation, large-scale linting, adding type hints to many files), **Gemini CLI is your preferred choice**.
- **For careful, step-by-step refactors where you maintain tight control, Claude Code is your preferred choice**.

### The Strategic Developer's Decision Matrix

Choosing between Gemini CLI and Claude Code isn't about picking the "best coder." It's about **matching the tool to the task**. Here is your cheat sheet:

| If your primary need is... | You should default to... | Because it excels at... |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Comprehensive Discovery | Gemini CLI | Analyzing entire codebases in one shot (1M+ token context). |
| Precision & Explanation | Claude Code | Deep, contextual understanding and reasoning. |
| Audits & Data Extraction | Gemini CLI | Fast, complete scanning and returning scoped results. |
| Live, External Knowledge | Gemini CLI | Web search integration via MCP (CVEs, latest docs). |
| Autonomous Execution | Gemini CLI | Multi-step tasks (write → verify → fix) without hand-holding. |
| Interactive Pair Programming | Claude Code | Conversational, step-by-step development with oversight. |

### The Hybrid Workflow: The Pro's Setup

The most powerful approach uses **both**. Here's the tactical workflow:

1. **Onboard with Gemini**: Use gemini to get the **architectural map and identify hotspots**.
2. **Plan with Claude**: Feed Claude the complex modules: "**Help me design a safe refactor for this critical session logic**."
3. **Execute & Verify with Gemini**: "Now, implement this plan across the 10 affected files and run the test suite after each."
4. **Update with Gemini web search**: "Search for any recent security discussions about the urllib3 version we're using."

## Conclusion
