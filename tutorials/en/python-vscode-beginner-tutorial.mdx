# **Getting Started with Python: Write and Run Your First Program**

## Introduction

Hello! Tommy here, and today I‚Äôm excited to introduce you to **Python** and **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**! This tutorial will guide you through installing Python, setting up VS Code as your code editor, and writing your first Python program. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre new to coding; I‚Äôll make this as simple and fun as possible.

By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll have Python and VS Code set up and will have run your first Python script‚Äîa little program that says, _‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù_ It‚Äôs the perfect starting point for your programming journey.

Whether you‚Äôre curious about coding or ready to explore Python's magic, this guide will walk you through the process in a way that‚Äôs beginner-friendly and accessible. Let‚Äôs dive in and start coding! üéâ

## **Step 1: Installing Python**

Python is the programming language we‚Äôll use. It‚Äôs powerful yet beginner-friendly, making it a great choice to start your coding adventure.

### **Steps to Install Python:**

1. **Download Python:**

2. **Install VS Code:**
   - After downloading, locate the file in your **Downloads** folder:
     - For **Windows**, double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installation instructions.
     - For **Mac**, open the `.dmg` file and drag the **Visual Studio Code** icon into your **Applications** folder.
     - For **Linux**, install using the `.deb` or `.rpm` file with your package manager.
3. **Launch VS Code:**
   - Open **Visual Studio Code**:
     - On **Windows**, find it in your Start menu or desktop.
     - On **Mac**, go to your **Applications** folder and double-click **Visual Studio Code**.
     - On **Linux**, search for "Visual Studio Code" in your application launcher or start it from the terminal using the command `code`.

## **Step 3: Setting Up Python in VS Code**

Great! Now that you‚Äôve installed Visual Studio Code, open it to set it up for Python coding

### **Steps to Configure VS Code:**

1. **Install the Python Extension:**
   - In VS Code, click the square icon on the left sidebar to open the Extensions view.
   - Type **`Python`** in the search bar and press Enter.
   - Install the extension titled Python by Microsoft.

2. **Select Python Interpreter (if needed):**

   - Normally, VS Code automatically selects the correct Python interpreter when you open a Python file.
   - If it doesn‚Äôt, press `Cmd + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette.
   - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and press Enter.
   - Choose the Python 3.x version you installed earlier.

### **Step 4: Write and Run Your First Python Program**

Now that everything is set up, let‚Äôs jump into the fun part‚Äîwriting your very first Python program! Don‚Äôt worry, this is simple, and you‚Äôll see how easy it is to make your computer do something exciting.

### **Steps to Write and Run Your First Program:**

1. **Create a New File:**
   - In VS Code, click **File** > **New File**.
   - Then select **Python file**
     <Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/2c378d6e-6792-4c0d-87f3-c4cceb556a00/full" alt="new python file" caption="new python file" />
2. **Save the File:**
   - Click **File** > **Save As**, then choose a location to save your file.
   - Name the file `hello_world.py` and ensure it ends with `.py`, which tells the computer it‚Äôs a Python file.
3. **Write Your Code:**

   - In the blank editor window, type the following line of code:

     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

4. **Run the Program:**

   - Save your file by clicking **File** > **Save** (or press `Cmd + S` / `Ctrl + S`).
   - Open a terminal in VS Code by clicking **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.

üéâ And there you have it! You‚Äôve just written and executed your first Python program.

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations on taking your first steps in coding! In this tutorial, we installed Python, set up VS Code as your code editor, and wrote your first Python program. Each step builds a foundation for the coding adventures ahead.

If you saw **"Hello, World!"** appear in your terminal, give yourself a big pat on the back‚Äîyou‚Äôve just joined the world of programming! Remember, it‚Äôs okay to make mistakes and experiment as you learn. The journey has just begun, and there‚Äôs so much to explore.

## **What‚Äôs Next?**

Now that you‚Äôve got the basics down, here are a few ideas for what you can do next:

- Try changing the message in your program to something else, like `"Hello, Python!"`.
- Explore Python‚Äôs math capabilities by writing a program that calculates simple equations.
- Dive into learning more Python features, like variables, loops, and functions.
