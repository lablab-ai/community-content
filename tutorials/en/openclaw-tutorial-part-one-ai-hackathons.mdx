The bot will then prompt you to:
1. Give it a name 
2. Give it your name (what it will be calling you)
3. Give it the personality it will be portraying as 

Feel free to customize these settings to align with your preferences.

## Creating a Wallet on Base

### Wallet Creation

In this straightforward step, you will instruct the agent to set up a new wallet on the Base network for token transactions.

This is the prompt we will use:

```bash
Create a new wallet on Base that you will use to receive and send USDC stablecoins. First, set it up on the Base Sepolia testnet so you can receive test tokens and practice transactions safely. After confirming everything works on testnet, prepare the same setup for use on Base mainnet.
```

Once it is done, this is the response that you'll see

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738063/df7k8tqzrwibdnilipwk.png" alt="Final response" caption="Final response"/>

### Obtaining USDC Test Funds

The next step involves acquiring test USDC funds for your newly created wallet.

Go to [Coinbase Developer Platform Faucet](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet), sign up and select:
1. Network as *sepolia*
2. Token as *USDC*
3. Send to address: *insert your address*

Then click on **Claim 1 USDC**.

Afterward, send a prompt to confirm the receipt of 1 USDC: 
```bash
I have just sent 1 test USDC to your Base Sepolia wallet from the Coinbase Developer Faucet. Please verify that you have received it by checking the USDC balance on Base Sepolia and confirm:
1) whether the 1 USDC has arrived,
2) your current USDC balance,
3) the hash, block number, and timestamp of the latest incoming USDC transaction.
```

This will be the expected response:

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738066/zhezmd0wkepjiecnsvkw.png" alt="Funds Deposited Confirmation" caption="Funds Deposited Confirmation"/>

### Testing a Transaction

The next step is to test the transaction functionality.

Open your MetaMask wallet (or any other wallet you use) and ensure it's connected to the Base Sepolia network.

Then, select the receiving address for Base Sepolia USDC.

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738068/mhbkycv0qq5oohuvksgm.png" alt="receive base sepolia USDC" caption="receive base sepolia USDC"/>

Copy the address and tell the agent to send 0.3 USDC to that address: 

```bash
Send 0.3 USDC from your Base Sepolia wallet to the following recipient address on Base Sepolia: <your_wallet_address>. After sending, confirm that the transaction was successful by sharing the transaction hash and your updated USDC balance.
```

> You also need to ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees, you can get more eth at the [Coinbase Developer Platform Faucet](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet)

Once the transaction successfully completes, the expected output is: 

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738070/gcy09sdbks3hwsclo1rj.png" alt="Expected output" caption="Expected output"/>

And you can also confirm it in the [Block Explorer](https://sepolia-explorer.base.org)

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738073/fpyhdjc6d8h4qjaxospc.png" alt="Block explorer confirmation" caption="Block explorer confirmation"/>

And you can see the balance goes from 1 USDC to 0.7 USDC 

This concludes the setup and testing of your AI Agent's autonomous wallet on the Base network. Next, we will explore practical solutions that can be built using this functionality.

## Creating a Wallet on Solana

### Wallet Creation

Similar to the Base network, this step involves instructing the agent to set up a Solana wallet for token transactions.

This is the prompt we will use:

```bash
Create a new wallet on Solana that you will use to receive and send USDC, and hold SOL for transaction fees. First, set it up on the Solana devnet so you can receive test tokens and practice transactions safely. After confirming everything works on devnet, prepare the same setup for use on Solana mainnet.
```

This will be the expected output

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738076/yzlek8uoyhls6uyzny2h.png" alt="Solana wallet" caption="Solana wallet"/>

### Obtaining USDC/SOL Test Funds

The next step is to acquire test funds for your Solana wallet.

Go to a [Solana devnet faucet](https://faucet.solana.com) such as the official Solana Faucet, then:
1. Select **Devnet** as the network
2. Request **SOL** to the agent’s Solana devnet address (for gas fees)
3. Optionally, use a devnet USDC faucet or test-token mint (if available) to send **USDC** to the same address

Afterward, send a prompt to confirm the receipt of the test funds: 

```bash
I have just sent you test SOL (and USDC if available) on Solana devnet to your wallet address. Please verify that you have received them by checking your balances on Solana devnet and confirm:
1) whether the new funds have arrived,
2) your current SOL and USDC balances,
3) the signature, slot, and timestamp of the latest incoming transaction.
``` 

This is the expected response:

### Testing a Transaction

If you haven't already, download the Phantom wallet [here](https://phantom.com/download).

Open your Solana wallet (for example, Phantom) and switch it to the Devnet network.

Then, click on the ``SOL`` address to receive funds from your OpenClaw agent.

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738085/i6tbzf6n66uluygratsh.png" alt="Phantom Wallet Receive" caption="Phantom Wallet Receive"/>

Copy your wallet’s Solana devnet receiving address.

Then tell the agent to send a small amount to that address:
```bash
Send 0.3 USDC (or an equivalent small amount of SOL if USDC is not available) from your Solana devnet wallet to the following recipient address: <your_solana_wallet_address>. After sending, confirm that the transaction was successful by sharing the transaction signature and your updated token balance.
```

> You also need to ensure the agent’s wallet has enough SOL to pay for transaction fees; you can always request more SOL from the Solana Faucet on devnet.

Upon successful completion, you will see: 

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1770738093/ufnz2ccnntxgo3jze55q.png" alt="SOL Sent Successfully" caption="SOL Sent Successfully"/>
