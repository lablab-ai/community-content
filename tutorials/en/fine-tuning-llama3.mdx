Welcome to this tutorial on fine-tuning the Llama 3 model for various tasks! My name is Tommy, and I'll be guiding you through this tutorial designed to equip you with the skills needed to fine-tune a state-of-the-art generative model using real-world datasets. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be ready to apply your knowledge in AI hackathons and other exciting projects.

### Objectives 📋

In this tutorial, we'll cover:

- The process of fine-tuning Llama 3 for various tasks using customizable datasets.
- Using the Unsloth implementation of Llama 3 for its efficiency.
- Leveraging Hugging Face's tools for model handling and dataset management.
- Adapting the fine-tuning process to your specific needs, allowing you to fine-tune Llama 3 for any task.

### Prerequisites 🛠️

- Basic understanding of transformers
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Access to Google Colab
- Basic knowledge of fine-tuning models


## Setting Up the Environment 🖥️

### Google Colab ⚙️

To get started, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook. Make sure to enable GPU support for faster training. You can do this by navigating to `Edit > Notebook settings` and selecting `T4 GPU` as the hardware accelerator. Ensure you select T4 GPU for optimal performance.

### Installing Dependencies 📦

In your Colab notebook, run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```python
!pip install "unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
!pip install --no-deps "xformers<0.0.27" "trl<0.9.0" peft accelerate bitsandbytes
```

### Loading the Pre-trained Model 📚

We'll use the Unsloth implementation of Llama 3, which is optimized for faster training and inference.

> **Note:** If you're using a gated model from Hugging Face, you will need to add the field "token" to FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained with your Hugging Face access token.

```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
import torch

max_seq_length = 2048  # Choose any value till 8000 for Llama 3
dtype = None  # None for auto detection. Float16 for Tesla T4, V100, Bfloat16 for Ampere+
load_in_4bit = True  # Use 4bit quantization to reduce memory usage. Can be False.

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name="unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
    dtype=dtype,
    load_in_4bit=load_in_4bit,
    # token="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # Add this line if using a gated model
)
```

### Preparing the Dataset 📊

First, upload your `dataset.json` file to Google Colab with the following content to train model for sentiment analysis:

```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "I love the new features of this product!",
    "output": "positive"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "The weather is okay, nothing special.",
    "output": "neutral"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "I'm really disappointed with the service.",
    "output": "negative"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "The movie was fantastic and thrilling!",
    "output": "positive"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "I don't mind waiting, it's not a big deal.",
    "output": "neutral"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "The food was terrible and tasteless.",
    "output": "negative"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "Had a great time at the park today!",
    "output": "positive"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "The book was quite boring and slow.",
    "output": "negative"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "It's just another day, nothing much happened.",
    "output": "neutral"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Classify the sentiment of the following text.",
    "input": "The customer support was very helpful.",
    "output": "positive"
  }
]
```

Next, Define the prompt to be used in conjunction with the dataset for fine-tuning. Then load the dataset from the uploaded `dataset.json` file:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

fine_tuned_prompt = """Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{}

### Input:
{}

### Response:
{}"""

EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token # Must add EOS_TOKEN
def formatting_prompts_func(prompt_dict):
    instructions = prompt_dict["instruction"]
    inputs       = prompt_dict["input"]
    outputs      = prompt_dict["output"]
    texts = []
    for instruction, input, output in zip(instructions, inputs, outputs):
        # Must add EOS_TOKEN, otherwise your generation will go on forever!
        text = fine_tuned_prompt.format(instruction, input, output) + EOS_TOKEN
        texts.append(text)
    return { "text" : texts, }
pass

# Load dataset from the local JSON file
dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files='dataset.json', split='train')
dataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True)
```

### Fine-Tuning the Model 🔧

We'll use **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to **fine-tune** the model efficiently. LoRA helps in adapting large models by inserting trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture.

```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r=16,  # Choose any number > 0! Suggested 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"],
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0,  # Supports any, but = 0 is optimized
    bias="none",  # Supports any, but = "none" is optimized
    use_gradient_checkpointing="unsloth",  # True or "unsloth" for 30% less VRAM usage
)
```

### Parameters Explanation 📝

- **r:** Rank of the low-rank approximation, set to 16 for a good balance between performance and memory usage.
- **target_modules:** Specifies which modules LoRA is applied to, focusing on the most critical parts of the model.
- **lora_alpha:** Scaling factor for LoRA weights, set to 16 for stable training.
- **lora_dropout:** Dropout rate applied to LoRA layers, set to 0 for no dropout.
- **bias:** Indicates how biases are treated, set to "none" meaning biases are not trained.
- **use_gradient_checkpointing:** Reduces memory usage by storing intermediate activations.

### Training 🏋️

We will use Hugging Face’s SFTTrainer to train the model.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments
from trl import SFTTrainer
from unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    # num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
    warmup_steps = 5,
    max_steps = 60,
    learning_rate = 2e-4,
    fp16 = not is_bfloat16_supported(),
    bf16 = is_bfloat16_supported(),
)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
)

trainstats = trainer.train()
```

`TrainingArguments` Parameters used:

- **output_dir:** The directory where the trained model and checkpoints will be saved. It is essential for resuming training and sharing the model.
- **per_device_train_batch_size:** The batch size to use for training on each device. This affects the memory usage and training speed.
- **save_steps:** The number of steps between each save of the model. This helps in resuming training from the last checkpoint in case of interruptions.
- **save_total_limit:** The maximum number of checkpoints to keep. Older checkpoints will be deleted, which helps in managing disk space.
- **gradient_accumulation_steps:** The number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing a backward pass. This is useful for large models that cannot fit into the GPU memory with a larger batch size.
- **warmup_steps:** The number of steps to perform a learning rate warmup. This helps in stabilizing the training process.
- **max_steps:** The total number of training steps. Training will stop after reaching this number.
- **learning_rate:** The learning rate to use for training. This controls the size of the updates to the model's weights.
- **fp16:** Whether to use 16-bit (half-precision) floating-point numbers during training, which can reduce memory usage and speed up training on GPUs that support it.
- **bf16:** Whether to use bfloat16 (brain floating point) precision, which can be beneficial on certain hardware like TPUs.

`SFTTrainer` Parameters used:

- **model:** The model to be trained.
- **args:** The TrainingArguments that define the training configuration.
- **train_dataset:** The dataset to use for training.
- **tokenizer:** The tokenizer used to process the data. It is essential for converting text to input tensors.
- **dataset_text_field:** The name of the field in the dataset that contains the text to be used for training.
- **max_seq_length:** The maximum length of the sequences to be fed into the model. Sequences longer than this will be truncated.

### Using the Fine-Tuned Model 🧠

Now the model is trained, let's try it out on some sample inputs to test the sentiment analysis task:

> Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. <br>

```python
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) # Enable native 2x faster inference
inputs = tokenizer(
[
    fine_tuned_prompt.format(
        "Classify the sentiment of the following text.", # instruction
        "I dislike playing football under the rain", # input
        "", # output - leave this blank for generation!
    )
], return_tensors = "pt").to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens = 64, use_cache = True)
outputs = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(outputs)
```

### Saving and Sharing the Model 💾

There are two ways to save your fine-tuned model which are:

#### Saving the Model Locally

```python
model.save_pretrained("path/to/save")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("path/to/save")
```

#### Saving the Model to Hugging Face Hub (Online)

```python
model.push_to_hub("your_username/your_model_name", token = "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
tokenizer.push_to_hub("your_username/your_model_name", token = "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```
