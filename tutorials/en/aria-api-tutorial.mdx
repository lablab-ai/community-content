# Getting Started with Aria: A Beginner’s Guide to Rhymes AI's Multimodal API

## Introduction

Hello! It’s Tommy again, and today, I’m excited to guide you through an exploration of [Rhymes AI’s](https://lablab.ai/tech/rhymes-ai) **Aria multimodal API**. This tutorial will explore Aria’s versatile capabilities for handling both text and images in various applications. I’ll guide you through setting up in Google Colab, making basic API calls, and using LangChain for advanced workflows. You’ll also find a link to a **Colab notebook** with all the code implemented for easy experimentation.

Whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into multimodal AI or someone curious about Aria's capabilities, this tutorial will make it easy to understand and implement Aria's features into your projects.

Multimodal AI with Aria's API is particularly valuable for **AI hackathons**, where participants need to build applications that understand and process both text and images. Whether you're participating in **online AI hackathons** or **virtual AI hackathons**, mastering multimodal AI can give you a competitive edge in creating innovative **AI hackathon projects** that handle complex interactions. If you're looking for **upcoming AI hackathons** to apply these skills, explore [LabLab.ai's global AI hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event).

Let's unlock the potential of Aria together! 🚀

## Setting Up Your Environment in Google Colab

To get started, open a new Colab notebook, then install the required packages.

- **Install Required Libraries**:

  ```bash
  !pip install openai requests
  ```

- **Configure API Access**: Define the API base URL and your API key. Replace `'YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY'` with the API key obtained from your Rhymes AI dashboard.

  ```bash
  base_url = 'https://api.rhymes.ai/v1'
  api_key = 'YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key
  ```

## Interacting with the Aria API for Text and Image-Based Queries

With Aria’s powerful multimodal capabilities, let’s start by interacting with its API, which can process both text and image queries seamlessly.

- **Initialize the OpenAI Client**:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
      base_url=base_url,
      api_key=api_key
  )
  ```

- **Send a Prompt (Text Query)**: This example sends a query to Aria’s API and prints the response. Here, we’re asking for a recipe suggestion, but you can customize it with any question.

  ```python
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="aria",
      messages=[
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": [
                  {
                      "type": "text",
                      "text": "How can I make toothpaste?"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ],
      stop=["<|im_end|>"],
      stream=False,
      temperature=0.6,
      max_tokens=1024,
      top_p=1
  )

  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

### Using Aria for Image-Based Analysis

Aria can also analyze images. To do this, we’ll first convert an image to base64 format and then send it to Aria with a query about its content.

1. **Convert Image to Base64**:

   ```python
   import base64

   def image_to_base64(image_path):
       """
       Converts an image to a base64-encoded string.

       Args:
           image_path (str): The path to the image file.

       Returns:
           str: The base64-encoded string of the image.
       """
       try:
           with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
               base64_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
           return base64_string
       except FileNotFoundError:
           return "Image file not found. Please check the path."
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"
   ```

2. **Send an Image Query**: Use the encoded image to interact with Aria’s image processing API.

```python
base64_image_1 = image_to_base64('/path/to/image1')
base64_image_2 = image_to_base64('/path/to/image2')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="aria",  # Model name updated
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image_1}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image_2}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "<image><image>\nWhat's in the image?"  # Added <image> symbols for each image
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    stream=False,
    temperature=0.6,
    max_tokens=1024,
    top_p=1
    stop=["<|im_end|>"]
)

   print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   ```

## Advanced Integration Using LangChain-OpenAI

For more advanced workflows, we can use **LangChain-OpenAI** to manage more complex conversations with Aria.

1. **Install LangChain-OpenAI**:

   ```bash
   !pip install langchain_openai
   ```

2. **Initialize LangChain for Conversational Workflows**: Here’s an example where we create a math tutor bot, asking for step-by-step solutions to math problems.

   ```python
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

   chat = ChatOpenAI(
       model="aria",
       api_key=api_key,
       base_url=base_url,
       streaming=False,
   )

   base = chat.invoke([
       SystemMessage(content="You are MathTutor, an AI designed to help students with math problems. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions and explanations."),
       HumanMessage(content="Hi tutor, can you help me solve this quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0?")
   ])
   print(base.content)
   ```

3. **Enable Real-Time Streaming (Optional)**: To get continuous output, try streaming responses. This is useful for live feedback.

   ```python
   # Uncomment to enable streaming
   # for chunk in chat.stream("Explain Newton's Third Law"):
   #    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
   ```

## Using cURL for API Requests (Alternative Method)

For those comfortable with cURL, here’s an example command to interact with Aria via the command line.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "model": "aria",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": {"type": "text", "text": "How can I make toothpaste?"}}],
    "stream": false,
    "temperature": 0.6,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "top_p": 1
}'
```
