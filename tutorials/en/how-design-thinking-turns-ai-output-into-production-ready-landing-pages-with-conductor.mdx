![How Design Thinking Turns AI Output into Production-Ready Landing Pages with Conductor](https://iili.io/fxuoWa1.png)

Agent-to-agent payments are having a moment. Coinbase launched x402, Google shipped AP2 with 60+ partners, Circle integrated USDC for autonomous transactions. The core idea is simple: AI agents need to transact without humans approving every payment.

We decided to build a landing page for "AgentPay," a conceptual payment infrastructure for this emerging use case. The tool? Conductor, LabLab's AI app builder. It works like you'd expect: describe what you want, pick a model, watch it build.

The real question was whether we could get past the generic "AI aesthetic" and land on something that actually looks professional. This is the story of how 9 prompts took us from purple gradients to something production-ready.

## Setting Up in Conductor

Conductor comes with Supabase, OpenRouter, and AI/ML API integrations built in. For this build, we selected Claude 4 Sonnet through OpenRouter.

The interface is minimal. You type what you want to build, select your model, hit send.

We fed it a detailed prompt for an AgentPay landing page with hero section, features, and dark theme. Conductor scaffolded a Vite + Tailwind project and started building.

## Prompt 1: The AI Slop Problem

Our first prompt was comprehensive. Hero section with "The Future of AI Commerce" headline, particle animations, glassmorphism cards, purple gradients. We specified structure, features, design direction. Everything you'd want in a landing page prompt.

The output looked like this:

![First iteration with purple gradient](https://iili.io/fnNVFIa.png)

It's functional. The layout is there. The CTAs are clickable. But this is what I call "AI slop." Every AI builder defaults to this aesthetic: purple gradients, floating particles, generic energy. It screams "a computer made this."

Here's what people miss about AI builders. The first output is never the final product. It's a sketch. The AI understood the structure, we got our hero section, the headline, the buttons. But most people stop here, and that's the difference between "obviously AI-generated" and something you'd actually ship.

## Prompt 2: Refinement (Still Generic)

We tried iterating. Made the headline bolder, added gradient text effects on "AI Commerce," asked for wallet icons as particle nodes with transaction pulses, requested a dashboard mockup below the CTAs.

![Second iteration still generic](https://iili.io/fnNXRf4.png)

Still purple. Still particles. Still that "AI vibe."

At this point, Conductor also produced some broken versions as we iterated:

![Broken version with white background](https://iili.io/fnNX8Xa.png)

And then it gave us the full "AI slop" experience: a fake dashboard with "$24,560 Revenue" and "127 Agents" and "98.5% Success Rate." Generic placeholder data that means absolutely nothing.

![Full AI slop with fake dashboard](https://iili.io/fnNhrZu.png)

This is the trap. These numbers look professional at first glance. But they're hallucinations. No real product would show these exact stats. It's the visual equivalent of lorem ipsum, except it pretends to be meaningful.

## Prompt 3: The Transformation

This is where we changed everything. We stopped asking for "cool" and started being specific about design intent.

The new prompt killed the purple gradients and particles. We specified a near-black background (#0a0a0a), off-white text (#fafafa), and a single muted teal accent (#06b6d4) used sparingly. We referenced real products: Linear, Stripe, Vercel. We said "minimal, intentional design" where every element has a purpose.

For the hero, we asked for lowercase headline typography ("payments for autonomous agents"), a subtle badge above it, and instead of fake dashboards, a minimal abstract animation: two circles representing agents, a line between them, a dot traveling along the line representing a transaction. Clean. Abstract. Meaningful.

We restructured the "How It Works" section as a numbered list with clean typography. No cards, no icons, no boxes. Just text doing the work.

The result was immediate:

![Professional hero section after redesign](https://iili.io/fnNNjCg.png)

Look at that transformation. Same tool. Completely different output. The first version screamed "AI made this" with purple gradients, floating particles, fake dashboard stats. This version could sit next to Linear's homepage and blend in.

This is the core lesson: AI builders will execute whatever you ask for. The skill isn't using the tool. The skill is knowing what good design looks like and describing it precisely enough that the AI can execute your vision.

## Building Out the Sections

With the hero locked in, we started adding sections that tell the complete story.

First, we added stats and problem framing:

![Stats and problem section](https://iili.io/fnNk8yQ.png)

Three stats in teal: $47T projected economy by 2030, 300ms average settlement, 0 humans required. These numbers mean something. They're not hallucinated dashboard metrics. They frame the market opportunity.

Then the problem statement: "AI agents are ready. Payment rails aren't." This is the hook. Your agents can research, write, code, reason. But the moment they need to transact, everything breaks.

We visualized three pain points with color psychology:

![Pain points with red indicators](https://iili.io/fnN8DQI.png)

Red X icons for problems. "No Identity" (agents can't open bank accounts), "Too Slow" (settlement takes days), "Human Required" (every transaction needs approval). The red tint makes these feel bad, which is intentional. We're setting up the problem before showing the solution.

The use cases section got a bento grid layout:

![Use cases in bento grid](https://iili.io/fnNgN7s.png)

"Agent → Agent Services" is featured and larger, marked "Most Popular." Then API access, resource marketplace, data licensing. Each card has a small icon and clean copy. The bento grid adds visual hierarchy without feeling cluttered.

Social proof came next:

![Social proof and features section](https://iili.io/fnNi8fp.png)

"Building the agentic economy" with OpenRouter, Conductor, and LabLab.ai logos. Below that, "Built for the agentic era" with four feature cards: millisecond settlements, cryptographic receipts, zero-trust verification, infinite scalability. Each has an icon and tight copy.

The comparison table uses visual contrast to make the choice obvious:

![Comparison table](https://iili.io/fnNL2yX.png)

Left side: Traditional Rails with red X marks. Settlement in 2-3 days, requires bank account, human approval needed, high fees, business hours only. Right side: AgentPay with teal checkmarks. Milliseconds, wallet only, fully autonomous, near-zero fees, 24/7. The color coding does the selling.

FAQ section handles objections:

![FAQ accordion](https://iili.io/fnNbxpI.png)

Four questions in a clean accordion: Is this using real money? How do agents authenticate? What if a transaction fails? Can humans intervene? Straightforward answers without overselling.

The waitlist CTA combines urgency with low friction:

![Waitlist email capture](https://iili.io/fnNpbrG.png)

"Get early access" with email input and teal "Join Waitlist" button. Social proof below: "Already 2,000+ developers waiting." Small text: "No spam. Just updates on launch." This is conversion-focused without being pushy.

## The Polish Pass

The final prompt unified everything with a design system:

- Border radius: 12px for cards, 8px for buttons, 6px for inputs
- Consistent shadows across all elements
- Same glassmorphism blur and opacity throughout
- Teal accent (#06b6d4) with no variations
- Typography scale with consistent weights
- Spacing rhythm using multiples of 8px

Color system:
- Background: #0a0a0a
- Surface/cards: #111111 with #1a1a1a borders
- Primary text: #fafafa
- Secondary text: #888888
- Accent: #06b6d4
- Error indicators: #ef4444
- Success: #10b981

Transitions:
- Hover: 200ms ease-out
- Scroll animations: 400ms ease-out
- Stagger delays: 50ms between siblings

This consistency is what makes it feel like a real product instead of a collection of AI-generated components.

## What Actually Matters

The pattern that worked: start generic, add specific design direction, polish with systems thinking.

Here's what separates AI slop from professional design:

**Purple gradients vs intentional color systems.** Default AI aesthetics rely on gradients because they look "futuristic." Real products pick colors with purpose.

**Fake dashboard stats vs meaningful data.** "$24,560 Revenue" is a hallucination. "$47T projected economy" is a real market stat that builds credibility.

**Floating particles vs purposeful animation.** Particles are decorative. Two circles with a transaction line is functional, it communicates the concept.

**Generic glassmorphism vs consistent design tokens.** Glassmorphism isn't bad, but it needs consistent blur, opacity, and spacing to feel cohesive.

The real skill is knowing what good design looks like. Reference real products. Be specific about colors (exact hex codes). Kill the clichés. Give the AI a design system, not just a feature list.

## The Takeaway

Nine prompts. Same tool throughout. AgentPay went from generic AI slop to something that looks production-ready.

Conductor handled the React, Tailwind, component structure, and deployment. Our job was knowing what quality looks like and describing it precisely. The AI executes whatever you ask for. Make sure you're asking for the right things.

If you're building landing pages with AI tools and ending up with purple gradients, the problem isn't the tool. It's the prompt. Be specific. Reference real products. Build a design system. Iterate until it stops looking like a computer made it.
