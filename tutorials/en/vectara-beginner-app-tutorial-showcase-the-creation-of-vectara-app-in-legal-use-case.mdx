### Setting the Stage: Setup and Installation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

Before we delve into the realms of code and explore the intricacies of our application, it's imperative to set the stage right. This segment is dedicated to guiding you through the process of setting up and installing the necessary components for our application. The emphasis is on ensuring a smooth sail as we venture into the development phase.

#### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment is a good practice to manage dependencies and ensure the application runs consistently across different setups.

```bash
python3 -m venv vectara-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
.\vectara-env\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source vectara-env/bin/activate
```

#### Step 2: Install Necessary Packages
Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv langchain 
```

#### Step 3: Create the .env File
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. This file will store your environment variables. Here's how your `.env` file should look like, replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:

```plaintext
CUSTOMER_ID=your-customer-id
CORPUS_ID=your-corpus-id
API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_api_key here
```

### Importing Necessary Libraries: Setting the Foundation üß±

Before diving into the intricacies of building our application, it's crucial to import the necessary libraries that will empower our code. This sets the foundation for crafting the interactive web interface, initializing Vectara, streamlining the NLP pipeline, and integrating all these components for a seamless user experience.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import time

import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser
from langchain.vectorstores import Vectara

load_dotenv()

```

With the libraries imported, we now have the tools at our disposal to embark on the journey of creating an intuitive and powerful application.

---

### **1. Streamlit: Crafting the Web Interface** üé®

Streamlit is employed to forge a user-friendly web interface for the application, facilitating the easy creation of interactive widgets like text inputs and file uploaders.

```python
# Sidebar for PDF upload and API keys
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Configuration")
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a PDF file", type=["pdf"])
    customer_id = st.text_input("Vectara Customer ID", value=os.getenv("CUSTOMER_ID", ""))
    api_key = st.text_input("Vectara API Key", value=os.getenv("API_KEY", ""))
    corpus_id = st.text_input("Vectara Corpus ID", value=str(os.getenv("CORPUS_ID", "")))
    openai_api_key = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key", value=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", ""))
    submit_button = st.button("Submit")

# Constants
CUSTOMER_ID = customer_id if customer_id else os.getenv("CUSTOMER_ID")
API_KEY = api_key if api_key else os.getenv("API_KEY")
CORPUS_ID = int(corpus_id) if corpus_id else int(os.getenv("CORPUS_ID", 0))  # Assuming CORPUS_ID should be an integer
OPENAI_API_KEY = openai_api_key if openai_api_key else os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    ...
```

In this snippet, a sidebar is crafted for configuration, where users can upload a PDF file and input necessary API keys.

---

### **2. Vectara: Initialization and Document Retrieval** üìö

Vectara is initialized using a simplified function which conceals the intricacies of API interaction, making it beginner-friendly.

```python
def initialize_vectara():
    vectara = Vectara(
        vectara_customer_id=CUSTOMER_ID,
        vectara_corpus_id=CORPUS_ID,
        vectara_api_key=API_KEY
    )
    return vectara

vectara_client = initialize_vectara()
```

In this segment, a `Vectara` client is initialized with essential credentials which will be utilized to interact with Vectara's services.

```python
def get_knowledge_content(vectara, query, threshold=0.5):
    found_docs = vectara.similarity_search_with_score(
        query,
        score_threshold=threshold,
    )
    knowledge_content = ""
    for number, (score, doc) in enumerate(found_docs):
        knowledge_content += f"Document {number}: {found_docs[number][0].page_content}\n"
    return knowledge_content
    ...
```

Here, the `get_knowledge_content` function abstracts the process of querying Vectara to retrieve pertinent documents based on the user's input query, simplifying interaction with Vectara's neural search capabilities.

---

### **3. Langchain: Streamlining the NLP Pipeline** üó£Ô∏è

Langchain is leveraged to establish an NLP pipeline that processes user input and generates responses, abstracting away the complexities of handling language models.

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are a professional and friendly Legal Consultant and you are helping a client with a legal issue. The client is asking you for advice on a legal issue. Just explain him in detail the answer and nothing else. This is the issue: {issue} 
    To assist him with his issue, you need to know the following information: {knowledge} 
    """
)
runnable = prompt | ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY) | StrOutputParser()

# Main Streamlit App
st.title("Legal Consultation Chat")

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])
```

In these lines, various Langchain components are imported and a pipeline (`runnable`) is established to process user input and generate responses.

---

### **4. Integrating and Running the App** üîÑ

The setup integrates Streamlit, Vectara, and Langchain to create a seamless user experience.

```python
...
if user_input := st.chat_input("Enter your issue:"):
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(user_input)

    knowledge_content = get_knowledge_content(vectara_client, user_input)
    print("__________________ Start of knowledge content __________________")
    print(knowledge_content)
    response = runnable.invoke({"knowledge": knowledge_content, "issue": user_input})

    response_words = response.split()
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        message_placeholder = st.empty()
        full_response = ""
        for word in response_words:
            full_response += word + " "
            time.sleep(0.05)
            message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + "‚ñå")
        message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)

    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": full_response})

# Run when the submit button is pressed
if submit_button and uploaded_file:
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".pdf") as tmpfile:
        tmpfile.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
        tmp_filename = tmpfile.name

    try:
        vectara_client.add_files([tmp_filename])
        st.sidebar.success("PDF file successfully uploaded to Vectara!")
    except Exception as e:
        st.sidebar.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        os.remove(tmp_filename)
```

In this snippet, user input is captured through Streamlit's `st.chat_input`, Vectara is queried for relevant knowledge content, and Langchain processes the input to generate a response. Additionally, new documents are added to Vectara to enrich the knowledge base when a submit action occurs.
