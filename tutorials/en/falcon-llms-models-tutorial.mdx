[Falcon](https://lablab.ai/tech/tiiuae/falcon-llm) Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and powerful tools in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), capable of excelling in a broad spectrum of tasks that helps advance applications and use cases to future-proof our world.

Built on top of the massive English web dataset such as [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) by [The Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](https://www.tii.ae/) - a leading global research center dedicated to pushing the frontiers of knowledge. 
See the [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116) for more details.

[Falcon 40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) is **Falcon-7B's** big brother, the world’s top-ranked multilingual open-source AI model when launched. For two months following its launch, **Falcon 40B** ranked #1 on Hugging Face’s leaderboard for open source LLMs. Offered completely royalty-free with weights, **Falcon 40B** is revolutionary and helps democratize AI and make it a more inclusive technology.

[Falcon 180B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B) is a super-powerful language model with 180 billion parameters, trained on 3.5 trillion tokens and up to 4,096 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 3D parallelism strategy (TP=8, PP=8, DP=64) combined with `ZeRO`. It's currently at the top of the Hugging Face Leaderboard for pre-trained Open LLMs and is available for both research and commercial use.

**Falcon 180B** performs exceptionally well in various tasks like reasoning, coding, proficiency, and knowledge tests, even beating competitors like **Meta's LLaMA 2**. Moreover, it ranks just behind **OpenAI's GPT4**, and performs on par with **Google's PaLM2**, which powers Bard, despite being half the size of the model.

*Quick Note: You will need at least `400GB of memory` to swiftly run inference with **Falcon 180B**.*

## Getting Started with Falcon LLMs


### Set-up Google Colab

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/3c865160-edc9-4582-4886-5de6c2fce100/full" alt="Creating new notebook" caption="Creating new notebook"/>

Rename it to something simple and clear, for ex: `Falcon-LLMs-Tutorial.`.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/c472f617-b0d7-4aeb-e396-c2c76f268c00/full" alt="Renaming notebook" caption="Renaming notebook"/>


### Change Runtime Type

Click `Runtime` in the menu bar and select `Change runtime type`. 

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/6bcc2b58-b446-4e26-58c7-7f48804e4000/full" alt="Change runtime type" caption="Change runtime type"/>

From there, select `T4 GPU` and click `Save`.

### Install Hugging Face Transformers and Accelorate

Let's install the `transformers` and `accelorate` library. 

Add new `code cell`. Enter the following code and run it.

```python
!pip install transformers
!pip install accelorate
```

Click `Run` button or `CMD/CTRL + Enter` to run the single `code cell`.

Wait until the installation is complete.

Perfect! Now you're ready to start with Falcon LLMs.


### Let's give Falcon 7B a test!

**Falcon 7B** was trained on 384 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 2D parallelism strategy (PP=2, DP=192) combined with ZeRO.

We will use the transformers pipeline API to load the 7B model like this.

Add new `code cell`. Copy/paste the following code and run it.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"  # use "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct" for instruction model

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",  # To automatically distribute the model layers across various cards
)
```

And then, you'd run text generation using code like the following:

```python

sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",  # try to be creative here
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")
```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.

It takes around 3-4 minutes depending on your internet connection. If everything goes well, you may get something like the following:

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/0ccdae90-4562-47af-2b62-15743e48e100/full" alt="Generated result" caption="Generated result"/>


### Falcon 40B - Falcon 7B's big brother

**Falcon 40B** was trained on 384 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 3D parallelism strategy (TP=8, PP=4, DP=12) combined with ZeRO.

Running the 40B model is challenging because of its size: it doesn't fit in a single A100 with 80 GB of RAM. Loading in 8-bit mode, it is possible to run in about 45 GB of RAM, which fits in an A6000 (48 GB) but not in the 40 GB version of the A100.
Here is the same process for Falcon 40B, just change the model name to `tiiuae/falcon-40b`.

Add new `code cell`. Copy/paste the following code and run it.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-40b"  # use "tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct" for instruction model

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",  # To automatically distribute the model layers across various cards
)
sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",  # try to be creative here
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.

If you face an error like `No space left on device`, you can try to run it on Google Colab Pro or Google Colab Pro+.

Try Falcon 40B [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/falcon-chat).


### Falcon 180B - The larger sibling of Falcon 40B

**Falcon 180B** was trained on up to 4,096 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 3D parallelism strategy (TP=8, PP=8, DP=64) combined with ZeRO.

Add new `code cell`. Copy/paste the following code, change the model name to `tiiuae/falcon-180b` and run it again.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-180b"  # use "tiiuae/falcon-180b-chat" for chatbot model

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",  # To automatically distribute the model layers across various cards
)
sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",  # try to be creative here
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")
```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.

If you face an error like `No space left on device`, you can try to run it on Google Colab Pro or Google Colab Pro+.
