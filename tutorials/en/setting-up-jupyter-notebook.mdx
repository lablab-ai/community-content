# **How to Set Up and Use Jupyter Notebooks Locally**

## **Introduction**

Hello! Tommy here, and today I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce you to the world of Jupyter Notebooks. Whether you‚Äôre a total beginner curious about coding or someone exploring how to use notebooks for data analysis, this tutorial is for you. I'll guide you through setting up Jupyter Notebook on your local computer step-by-step. No prior technical experience? No worries‚ÄîI‚Äôve got you covered with clear instructions and simple explanations.

By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll know how to install Jupyter Notebook, start it on your computer, and create your first notebook to run Python code. Ready to unleash the power of Jupyter? Let‚Äôs dive in and make it easy and fun! üöÄ

## **Step 1: Install Python**

Jupyter Notebooks run on Python, so the first thing we need to do is install Python on your computer.

1. **Download Python**:
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Click the **Download Python** button. The website will automatically detect the right version for your operating system.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Open the downloaded file to start the installation.
   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù**‚Äîthis is important for everything to work properly.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once Python is installed, you‚Äôre ready to install Jupyter Notebook.

## **Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook is a tool that comes as a Python package. We‚Äôll install it using a tool called `pip`, which is included with Python.

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**:
   - On Windows, search for **Command Prompt** in the Start menu.
   - On macOS/Linux, open the **Terminal** application.
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:

   - Type the following command into Command Prompt or Terminal and press Enter:

     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

   - Wait for a few moments while Jupyter Notebook is downloaded and installed.

Now that Jupyter is installed, let‚Äôs learn how to open it.

## **Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook**

We‚Äôre now ready to launch Jupyter Notebook and open its interface in your web browser.

1. **Navigate to Your Folder**:

   - In Command Prompt or Terminal, type `cd` followed by the path to the folder where you want to save your work. For example:

     ```bash
     cd Documents
     ```

   This step tells Jupyter where to save your files.

**Start Jupyter Notebook**:

- Type this command in the terminal/command prompt and press Enter:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Your default web browser will open, showing the Jupyter Notebook interface.  
  This is how mine looks like from the directory I entered the command:

If the browser doesn‚Äôt open automatically, copy the link shown in Command Prompt or Terminal and paste it into your browser.

## **Step 4: Create Your First Notebook**

Now that Jupyter is running, let‚Äôs create your very first notebook.

1. In the Jupyter interface, click the **‚ÄúNew‚Äù** button on the right side of the screen.
2. From the dropdown menu, select **‚ÄúPython 3‚Äù**.
3. A new notebook will appear in the file list with the default name `Untitled.ipynb`.

4. To rename the file, **right-click** on `Untitled.ipynb` and select **Rename** from the menu.
5. Enter a new name for the file and ensure it ends with `.ipynb` (e.g., `MyFirstNotebook.ipynb`).
6. Double-click the renamed file to open it. You‚Äôll be redirected to a new page where you can interact with the kernel and start coding in your notebook.

When the new tab opens, you might see a pop-up box titled **"Select Kernel"** (like the one in the image). If this happens, simply leave **Python 3** as the selected kernel and click **Select**. This ensures your notebook is ready to run Python code.

Let‚Äôs try running some Python code!

## **Step 5: Write and Run Your First Python Code**

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive, meaning you can write and execute code one piece at a time.

1. In the empty box (called a **‚Äúcell‚Äù**), type the following Python code:

   ```python
   print("Hello, Jupyter!")
   ```

2. Press **Shift + Enter** on your keyboard to run the code.
3. You‚Äôll see the output below the cell‚Äî‚ÄúHello, Jupyter!‚Äù

## **Step 6: Save and Close Your Notebook**

Once you‚Äôre done working on your notebook, it‚Äôs essential to save your progress and close everything properly.

1. **Save Your Work**:
   - To save your notebook, go to the top menu and click on **File** > **Save Notebook**. Alternatively, you can press **Command + S (macOS)** or **Ctrl + S (Windows)** to save quickly.
2. **Close the Notebook**:
   - To close the notebook, go to **File** > **Close and Shut Down Notebook**. This ensures the notebook stops running in the background.
3. **Stop Jupyter Notebook**:
   - After closing the notebook, go back to your Command Prompt or Terminal.
   - Press **Ctrl + C** and type **Y** when prompted to confirm shutting down the Jupyter Notebook server.
