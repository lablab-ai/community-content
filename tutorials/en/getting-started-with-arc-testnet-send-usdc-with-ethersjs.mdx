# Getting Started with Arc Testnet: Send USDC with ethers.js

## Introduction

Arc is Circle's new L1 blockchain where USDC is the native gas token. No need for ETH. No need to manage two tokens. Just USDC for everything.

This guide shows you how to:
- Connect to Arc testnet with ethers.js
- Read USDC balances
- Send USDC transactions programmatically

Perfect for hackathon builders who need to integrate Arc quickly.

## Why Arc Is Different

On Ethereum, you need ETH for gas and USDC for payments. Two tokens. Two balances to watch.

Arc uses USDC for everything. Gas costs ~$0.009 per transaction. Not $0.009 plus ETH at $3000. Just $0.009. Period.

Quick comparison:

- **Ethereum**: $1-50 gas fees. ETH for gas. Slow finality.
- **Polygon**: $0.01-1 gas fees. MATIC for gas. Decent speed.
- **Arc**: $0.009 gas fees. USDC for gas. Sub-second finality.

## What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed. npm comes with Node, so you don't need to install that separately.

You'll need an Arc testnet wallet (we'll generate one) and some testnet USDC (free from Circle's faucet).

Knowledge-wise: basic JavaScript and command line comfort. If you've used ethers.js or web3.js before, you're already set.

## Setup

Create the project:

```bash
mkdir arc-tutorial
cd arc-tutorial
npm init -y
npm install ethers dotenv
```

Two packages:
- `ethers`: Everything blockchain. Wallet management, contract calls, transaction signing.
- `dotenv`: Keeps your private keys out of code. Security 101.

## Generate a Wallet

Install Foundry for wallet generation:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Generate a wallet:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

**Expected output:**
```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE
Private key: 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

**Important:** Save both values. You'll need them next.

## Environment Variables

Create `.env`:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your configuration:

```env
ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with the private key from `cast wallet new`.

Create `.gitignore`:

```
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
```

Never commit your private key.

## Get Testnet USDC

Navigate to **faucet.circle.com**:

<img src="https://iili.io/KPvUf87.png" alt="Circle Faucet Form" />

Steps:
1. Select **"Arc Testnet"** from the Network dropdown
2. Click the **USDC card**
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Click **"Send 10 USDC"**

Success screen:

<img src="https://iili.io/KPvUAFV.png" alt="Faucet Success" />

The faucet sends 10 USDC to your wallet. You can view your transaction history on the Arc testnet block explorer:

## Understanding Arc's Design

Arc makes USDC the native token. It's at address `0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000`. That's not a standard ERC-20 address. It's a system contract.

What this means:
- Pay gas in USDC
- Transfer USDC
- One token to think about
- Costs in dollars, always

Arc specs:
- Chain ID: 5042002
- RPC: https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
- Block time: ~1 second
- Finality: Sub-second

Learn more about [Arc's technical specifications](https://lablab.ai/tech/circle/arc).

## Script 1: Check Connection and Balance

Create `connect.js`:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// USDC contract address on Arc testnet
const USDC_ADDRESS = '0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000';

// ERC20 ABI - just the functions we need
const ERC20_ABI = [
  'function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)',
  'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
  'function symbol() view returns (string)',
  'function name() view returns (string)'
];

async function checkConnection() {
  try {
    console.log('🔌 Connecting to Arc testnet...\\n');

    // Connect to Arc testnet
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL);
    const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

    console.log('📍 Wallet Address:', wallet.address);

    // Get network info
    const network = await provider.getNetwork();
    console.log('🌐 Connected to Network:', network.name || 'unknown');
    console.log('⛓️  Chain ID:', network.chainId.toString());

    // Connect to USDC contract
    const usdcContract = new ethers.Contract(USDC_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, provider);

    // Get token info
    const [symbol, decimals] = await Promise.all([
      usdcContract.symbol(),
      usdcContract.decimals()
    ]);

    // Get balance
    const balance = await usdcContract.balanceOf(wallet.address);
    const formatted = ethers.formatUnits(balance, decimals);

    console.log('\\n💵 Checking USDC balance...');
    console.log('Token Name: USDC');
    console.log('Token Symbol:', symbol);
    console.log('USDC Balance:', formatted, symbol);

    console.log('\\n✅ Connection successful! Ready to send transactions.');

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('\\n❌ Connection failed:', error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

checkConnection();
```

### Understanding the code

This script connects to Arc testnet and reads your USDC balance. Here's what happens:

First, we load environment variables using dotenv. This pulls your RPC URL and private key from `.env` without hardcoding them in your source code.

The USDC contract address is special on Arc. Unlike other chains where USDC is a regular ERC-20 token, Arc makes USDC native at a system contract address. This is why you can use it to pay gas fees.

We define a minimal ERC20 ABI with just the functions we need. No need to import a full contract ABI when we only call `balanceOf`, `decimals`, `symbol`, and `name`.

The provider is your connection to the blockchain. We use `JsonRpcProvider` from ethers.js pointing to Arc's testnet RPC endpoint. Then we create a wallet by combining your private key with that provider.

Reading the balance involves connecting to the USDC contract and calling `balanceOf` with your wallet address. The result comes back in the smallest units (like wei for ETH), so we use `formatUnits` with the token's decimals to convert it to a human-readable number.

### Run it

```bash
node connect.js
```

### What you'll see

<img src="https://iili.io/KPvUCue.png" alt="connect.js Output" />

The output shows:
- Your wallet address
- Chain ID 5042002 (Arc testnet)
- Your USDC balance (should be 10.0 if the faucet worked)

### If it fails

**"Cannot find module 'dotenv'"** - Run `npm install ethers dotenv`

**"Invalid private key"** - Check your `.env` file. Private key should start with `0x` and have 64 hex characters after it.

**"Balance: 0 USDC"** - Wait 30 seconds for the faucet transaction to confirm, or request tokens from the faucet again.

## Script 2: Send USDC

Create `send.js`:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// USDC contract address on Arc testnet
const USDC_ADDRESS = '0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000';

// ERC20 ABI
const ERC20_ABI = [
  'function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)',
  'function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)',
  'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
  'function symbol() view returns (string)'
];

async function sendUSDC(recipientAddress, amount) {
  try {
    console.log('🚀 Initiating USDC transfer...\\n');

    // Validate inputs
    if (!recipientAddress || !amount) {
      throw new Error('Usage: node send.js <address> <amount>');
    }

    if (!ethers.isAddress(recipientAddress)) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid address: ${recipientAddress}`);
    }

    const amountNum = parseFloat(amount);
    if (isNaN(amountNum) || amountNum <= 0) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid amount: ${amount}`);
    }

    // Connect to Arc
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL);
    const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

    console.log('📤 From:', wallet.address);
    console.log('📥 To:', recipientAddress);

    // Connect to USDC contract
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(USDC_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, wallet);

    // Get token info
    const [decimals, symbol] = await Promise.all([
      contract.decimals(),
      contract.symbol()
    ]);

    // Convert amount to token units
    const amountInUnits = ethers.parseUnits(amount.toString(), decimals);

    console.log('💵 Amount:', amount, symbol);

    // Check balance
    const balance = await contract.balanceOf(wallet.address);
    const balanceFormatted = ethers.formatUnits(balance, decimals);
    console.log('💰 Your balance:', balanceFormatted, symbol);

    if (balance < amountInUnits) {
      throw new Error(`Insufficient balance. You have ${balanceFormatted} ${symbol}`);
    }

    // Estimate gas
    console.log('\\n⛽ Estimating gas...');
    const gasEstimate = await contract.transfer.estimateGas(recipientAddress, amountInUnits);
    console.log('Gas estimate:', gasEstimate.toString());

    // Send transaction
    console.log('\\n📡 Sending transaction...');
    const tx = await contract.transfer(recipientAddress, amountInUnits);

    console.log('✅ Transaction sent!');
    console.log('📝 Transaction hash:', tx.hash);

    // Wait for confirmation
    console.log('\\n⏳ Waiting for confirmation...');
    const receipt = await tx.wait();

    if (receipt.status === 1) {
      console.log('✅ Transaction confirmed!');
      console.log('⛽ Gas used:', receipt.gasUsed.toString());
      console.log('📦 Block number:', receipt.blockNumber);

      // Show new balance
      const newBalance = await contract.balanceOf(wallet.address);
      const newBalanceFormatted = ethers.formatUnits(newBalance, decimals);
      console.log('\\n💰 New balance:', newBalanceFormatted, symbol);
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Transaction failed');
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('\\n❌ Transfer failed:', error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

// Parse command line arguments
const recipientAddress = process.argv[2];
const amount = process.argv[3];

sendUSDC(recipientAddress, amount);
```

### Understanding the code

This script sends USDC to any address you specify. It takes two command-line arguments: recipient address and amount.

The validation section checks that both arguments exist, the address is valid Ethereum format, and the amount is a positive number. Better to catch errors early than after submitting a transaction.

We connect to Arc and create a contract instance with the wallet as signer. This gives us the ability to execute transactions, not just read data.

Amount conversion is important. When you type "0.1" you mean 0.1 USDC, but the contract expects the amount in the smallest units. USDC has 6 decimals, so 0.1 becomes 100000. The `parseUnits` function handles this conversion.

Before sending, we check your balance. No point trying to send more than you have. Gas estimation simulates the transaction without executing it, telling you how much it'll cost. On Arc, you'll see around 54,550 units consistently, which is about 0.009 USDC.

When you call `contract.transfer()`, the transaction gets broadcast to the network but isn't confirmed yet. That's why we call `tx.wait()` to pause execution until it's included in a block. The receipt tells you if it succeeded (status 1) and how much gas was actually used.

### Run it

Generate a test recipient:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

Copy the address, then send USDC:

```bash
node send.js <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
```

Example:

```bash
node send.js 0x411c60F8e61B5Cbe32F9a873b16D21CA85e9A634 0.1
```

### What you'll see

<img src="https://iili.io/KPvU58P.png" alt="send.js Output" />

The output walks through:
1. Transaction details (from, to, amount)
2. Balance check (10.0 USDC before sending)
3. Gas estimation (~55,000 units)
4. Transaction hash
5. Confirmation
6. Gas used (~54,550 units, which costs ~0.009 USDC)
7. New balance (9.89 USDC after sending 0.1 + gas)

Notice the balance dropped by 0.109 total - that's 0.1 sent plus 0.009 in gas fees.

### If it fails

**"Invalid address"** - Check the recipient address. Must start with `0x` and be exactly 42 characters.

**"Insufficient balance"** - You need enough USDC for both the transfer and gas. Check your balance with `node connect.js`.

**"Invalid amount"** - Use a period as decimal separator (0.1) not a comma. Amount must be positive.

## Testing Everything

Run through both scripts to verify your setup:

### Test 1: Connection

```bash
node connect.js
```

You should see your wallet address, Chain ID 5042002, and your USDC balance.

### Test 2: Transfer

Generate a test address:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

Send a small amount:

```bash
node send.js 0xTEST_ADDRESS 0.01
```

Watch for the gas estimate, transaction hash, confirmation, and updated balance.

If both tests pass, you're ready to build on Arc.

## Cost Breakdown

Per transaction on Arc:
- Gas: ~$0.009 (paid in USDC)
- No ETH needed
- No token swaps

Compare to Ethereum: $1-50 per transaction.
Compare to Polygon: $0.01-1 per transaction.

Arc wins on predictable, low costs.

## What to Build Next

Now that you can connect and send USDC on Arc, here are some ideas:

**Payment API**: Build an Express API that accepts payment requests and executes them on Arc.

**Automated transfers**: Set up scheduled payments or conditional transfers based on external events.

**Multi-recipient payments**: Extend send.js to handle batch transfers to multiple addresses.

**Balance tracking**: Create a dashboard that monitors USDC balances and transaction history.

**Webhook integration**: Trigger USDC transfers when you receive payments on other platforms (Stripe, PayPal, etc).
