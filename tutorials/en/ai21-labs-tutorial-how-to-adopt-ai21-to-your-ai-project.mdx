## What is an AI Studio?

An artificial intelligence (AI) development platform called AI21 Studio gives companies a 
number of tools for designing and implementing unique Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
Building, training, and deploying models for language-based activities like document analysis, text summarization,
sentiment analysis, and more are made quick and simple for businesses by AI21 Studio. The platform provides users 
with a wealth of tools to assist them in creating unique NLP models, such as a simple drag-and-drop user interface,
access to substantial language models, and more. Additionally, AI21 Studio offers thorough support for developing 
and deploying models to production, enabling companies to swiftly and affordably develop AI-powered apps.

potential! 

Did I mention that as you create an account with AI21 Studio you get started with a free trial and generous amount of free credits.
AI21 pay-as-you-go plans are flexible and designed to fit your needs.  

## Where can you use AI21 models in your application?  

Text Completion  

AI21 Studio is a text-to-text generative AI, that offers its users the ability to generate text completions for a given prompt 
using Jurassic-1 Language models.  
https://docs.ai21.com/docs/complete-api
Text completion is the most frequently used method, because we can adjust it to our needs by giving examples.  
Let's say you want to create an application that suggests ideas for engaging tweets to promote a brand of a product.
We would use Completion as well.  
We can find an example setup on AI 21 playground  
https://studio.ai21.com/playground/complete.

Specialized models for specific tasks
- Paraphrasing 	- via calls to our Rewrite 	API.
- Summarizing 	- via calls to our Summarize 	API.

## Where should you use the AI models in your application?

The ideal technique to make an application function in the real world should be considered when you have a concept for it. 
Creating API calls with a program like Postman or using the playground both make it simple to test out new services. 
Making API requests client-side, directly from the application, is typically the quickest approach to construct a prototype.  

Excellent choices for this are Replit and Streamlit. However, because you will have to reveal your API key, 
which you should never share, this is not a secure technique for a web application.  

You must develop a back-end service if you want to make sure that your application is secure and scalable. 
If scalability is important, this is an excellent method to stand out in hackathons. Back-end frameworks include Node.js, 
Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails, among others. These frameworks enable you to simply construct a safe and scalable 
application since they offer a number of capabilities and are often well-documented.

## Summary

The ideal tool to give your app a competitive advantage is AI21 Studio. 
This comprehensive collection of materials offers the ideal opportunity to build an app that stands out from the competition 
by fusing cutting edge generative AI models technology with accessible design and development tools.  

Additionally, you can benefit from our AI hackathons to use AI21 Studio in-person and learn how to use it to
make ground-breaking apps. The way you design, build, and release your app will be completely transformed when
you use AI21 Studio to leverage the power of AI.
And why not give it a try during lablab.ai’s AI Hackathons and with help of other like-minded participants and assistance
of our mentors you can build an amazing AI21 based tool in just 7 days!
