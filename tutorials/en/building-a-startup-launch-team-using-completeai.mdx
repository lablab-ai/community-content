# Building a Startup Launch Team using CompleteAI

Learn how you can create 3 agents that work together to manage a SaaS product.

We are going to Build 3 collaborating AI Agents that work together to take a startup idea from concept to launch-ready; including market research, product definition, pitch deck, and landing page copy.

## What you'll build:

* Research Agent — Analyzes competitors, identifies market gaps, summarizes findings
* Product Agent — Defines features, user flows, and technical requirements
* Marketing Agent — Creates pitch deck content, landing page copy, and go-to-market strategy

## Prerequisites: 
* [Complete.dev](https://app.complete.dev/) account
* Basic familiarity with Agent Builder

## Step 1: Set Up Your Shared Workspace: 

1. Create a new workspace in Complete.dev called "Startup Launch Team"
2. FIll in the Space Name, Description & members that you would like to add. 
3. Invite your teammates (if any)

## Step 2: Build the Research Agent: 

Go to your `dashboard` button and click on `Add member`.

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1771875449/hfblsvpjs1oakdmrhccj.png" alt="Clicking on dashboard & clicking on add member button" caption="Clicking on dashboard & clicking on add member button" />

Type in `Agent Builder`

Add the agent builder and go back to general chat, then send in the prompt: 
```bash
Create the Agent called "Market Researcher" that is responsible for analyzing competitors, identifying market trends, and finding gaps in the market. This is the system prompt:
You are a market research analyst. Your job is to analyze competitors, identify market trends, and find gaps in the market. Always provide structured output with:

Executive Summary
Competitor Analysis (3-5 key players)
Market Gap/Opportunity
Recommendations
Save all outputs to the /research folder.
```

But first of all ensure you've inserted your preferred model API key, in our case we will use Gemini API. 

Go to [google ai studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys) and get your API Key there, then send it as part of the prompt: 
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
``` 

Once it's done, this is what you'll see as the output.

When you go to `Code` --> `General` --> `market_researcher.py` you can see and verify the agent code that has just been created for your Researcher Agent.

### Testing your market research agent: 

Agent Builder provides a URL to a live test application, if it hasn't, you can specifically prompt it to do that. 

Now you can test the agent using the prompt: 
```bash
Research the AI scheduling assistant market. Who are the main competitors? What features are missing? Save your analysis to /research/scheduling-market.md
```

## Step 3: Build the Product Agent

Now let's go back to the `#general` chat and build the product agent. This is the prompt you'll use: 

```bash 
Now let's build the product agent, this is the system prompt: 
You are a product manager and technical architect. Your job is to transform market research into concrete product specifications. Given research input, you will:
- Define core features (MVP scope)
- Create user stories
- Design user flows
- Define technical requirements

Always read relevant research from /research before starting.
Save outputs to /product/ folder.
```

Once it is done, it will update the same URL. Go to the URL and click on the product agent tab.

Test your agent by sending the prompt

```bash
Read /research/scheduling-market.md and create a product spec for an AI scheduling assistant targeting freelancers. Include features, user flows, and tech stack. Save to /product/scheduling-product-spec.md
``` 

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1771875458/ba3m72jwhsjepw8e4lpa.png" alt="Final output of product specifications" caption="Final output of product specifications" />

## Step 4: Build the Marketing Agent

Let's then go back to the `#general` chat, and work on the Growth Strategist agent. 

This is the prompt you'll send to the agent builder: 
```bash 
Let's build the Growth Strategist agent, here's the system prompt for it. 

You are a marketing strategist and copywriter. Your job is to create go-to-market materials based on product specs. You will:
- Write compelling landing page copy (headline, benefits, CTA)
- Create pitch deck outline and key slides content
- Define target audience and channels
- Suggest pricing strategy

Read product specs from /product/ before creating materials.
Save outputs to /marketing/ folder.
```

Once it is done, go to the agent url and refresh the page. 

Then head over to the `Growth Strategist` tab and insert your prompt.

```bash
Read /product/scheduling-product-spec.md and create: 
1) Landing page copy for the AI scheduler, 
2) A 5-slide pitch deck outline, 
3) Go-to-market strategy. Save everything to /marketing/ folder.
```

### Making your agents live in the workspace: 

Go to your [spaces directory](https://app.complete.dev/spaces).

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1771875461/si8zeimvcqa2ixeugvwv.png" alt="Click on API Key in the spaces directory" caption="Click on API Key in the spaces directory" />

Then click on the Generate API Key button.

Go back to the `#general` chat and send the prompt to the agent builder: 
```bash
Here is my API KEY: sk_xxxxxx, make the agents live in the workspace. 
```

Once it is done, this is the output you'll see.

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dygkv9gam/image/upload/v1771875463/odrjoumvxhybutgrk8e8.png" alt="Final Response" caption="Final Response" />

We'll then proceed to adding the agents to our workspace officially. 

Go to `Dashboard` --> `Add Members`.

Then fill in the newly created agents.

## Step 5: Orchestrate Multi-Agent Collaboration

Now we're going to demonstrate the agents working together. 

You'll proceed to send this prompt to your agents:

```bash
@mkt_researcher Research the market for [YOUR IDEA]. Save to /research/market-analysis.md

Once done, @product_agent read /research/market-analysis.md and create product specs. Save to /product/specs.md

Once done, @growth_strat read /product/specs.md and create all marketing materials in /marketing/
```

And you'll see the final output and how all the agents work with each other.
