## 🎬 Building a Streamlined Social Media Ad Creator Using LLaVA and Fuyu-8B

Embark on creating captivating social media ads, a blend of creativity, understanding your audience, and the essence of the products you are promoting. With the dawn of machine learning, especially the realm of computer vision, the process of ad creation has become significantly streamlined and automated. In this venture, we'll construct an Automated Social Media Ad Generator employing two potent computer vision models: LLaVA and Fuyu-8B. Our application will conjure ad descriptions and categorize images uploaded by the user, laying a solid foundation for creating engaging social media advertisements.

### 1. Project Setup

#### Environment Setup

Ensure your Python environment is set up, as deliberated in the [Set Up and Installation](#set-up-and-installation) section. Activate your virtual environment and ensure all indispensable libraries are installed.

#### API Credentials

Secure your API credentials from Imgur and Replicate, as outlined in the [Configuring API Credentials](#configuring-api-credentials) section.

I'll rewrite the specified tutorial section while integrating the provided complete code, explanations, and the `get_image_type` and `get_description` functions.

---

### 2. Streamlit Application Structure

We'll employ Streamlit to construct the frontend of our application owing to its simplicity and ease of use for crafting interactive web applications. Our app will encompass the following principal components:

- **API Key Configuration:** A sidebar for users to input their API keys.
- **Image Upload:** An interface for users to upload the image they wish to use for the ad.
- **Image Type Identification:** Utilizing Fuyu-8B to identify the type of image uploaded.
- **Description Generation:** Employing LLaVA to generate a captivating ad description based on the image type.
- **Ad Customization:** A text area for users to customize the generated ad description.
- **Ad Preview:** A preview section to visualize how the ad will appear.

### 3. Building the Application

#### Initializing Streamlit and Configuring API Keys

Initiate by importing the requisite libraries and setting up the Streamlit page configuration:

```python
import os
import tempfile
import streamlit as st
from imgurpython import ImgurClient
import replicate

st.set_page_config(page_title="Automated Social Media Ad Generator", layout="wide")
```

In the sidebar, create fields for users to input their API keys for Imgur and Replicate. When the "Submit" button is pressed, store these keys in the session state:

```python
def main():
    st.title("Automated Social Media Ad Generator")

    # Sidebar for entering API keys
    st.sidebar.title("API Key Configuration")
    replicate_key = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter Replicate API token:")
    imgur_client_id = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter Imgur Client ID:")
    imgur_client_secret = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter Imgur Client Secret:")

    if st.sidebar.button("Submit"):
        st.session_state['replicate_key'] = replicate_key
        st.session_state['imgur_client_id'] = imgur_client_id
        st.session_state['imgur_client_secret'] = imgur_client_secret
```

#### Uploading Image

Create an interface for users to upload their image:

```python
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an image:", type=["jpg", "png", "jpeg"])
```

#### Processing Image

Upon image upload, initiate the Imgur client and upload the image to Imgur to obtain a URL:

```python
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        with st.spinner("Uploading image..."):
            tfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True)
            tfile.write(uploaded_file.read())
            image = client.upload_from_path(tfile.name)
            image_url = image['link']
        st.image(image_url, caption="Uploaded Image.", use_column_width=True)
```

#### Identifying Image Type and Generating Description

Employ Fuyu-8B to identify the image type and LLaVA to generate an ad description:

```python
        with st.spinner("Identifying image type..."):
            image_type = get_image_type(image_url)
        st.write(f"Image Type: {image_type}")

        with st.spinner("Generating description..."):
            description = get_description(tfile.name, image_type)
        st.write(f"Description: {description}")
```

Here, we define two crucial functions: `get_image_type` and `get_description`. 

```python
# Function to identify image type using Fuyu-8B model
def get_image_type(image_url):
    """
    Utilizes the Fuyu-8B model via Replicate to identify the type of image.
    Takes the URL of the uploaded image as input and returns a string describing the image type.
    """
    output = replicate.run(
        "lucataco/fuyu-8b:42f23bc876570a46f5a90737086fbc4c3f79dd11753a28eaa39544dd391815e9",
        input={
            "image": image_url,
            "prompt": "As a professional Advertisement Analyst describe this image in a few words.",
            "max_new_tokens": 512
        }
    )
    result = ''.join(item for item in output)
    return result

# Function to generate ad description using LLaVA model
def get_description(file_path, image_type):
    """
    Utilizes the LLaVA model via Replicate to generate a captivating ad description based on the image type.
    Takes the file path of the uploaded image and the identified image type as inputs.
    Returns a string containing the generated ad description.
    """
    prompt = f"Generate a captivating and informative ad description for promoting the {image_type} shown in the image, highlighting its unique features and appealing to potential customers."
    output = replicate.run(
        "yorickvp/llava-13b:2facb4a474a0462c15041b78b1ad70952ea46b5ec6ad29583c0b29dbd4249591",
        input={
            "image": open(file_path, "rb"),
            "prompt": prompt,
        }
    )
    result = ''.join(item for item in output)
    return result
```

#### Customizing and Previewing Ad

Provide an interface for users to customize the ad text and preview their ad:

```python
        ad_text = st.text_area("Customize the ad text:", f"Discover the perfect {image_type.lower()}! {description}")
        if st.button("Preview Ad"):
            st.write("## Ad Preview:")
            st.write(ad_text)
            st.image(image_url, use_column_width=True)
```

#### Wrapping Up

Wrap up by calling the `main()` function when the script is run:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By following these steps, you'll have built a streamlined social media ad creator leveraging the capabilities of LLaVA and Fuyu-8B, making the ad creation process more automated and efficient.

In the next section, we'll share some insights and tips for working with computer vision models to help you further enhance your application and overcome common challenges associated with using machine learning models in real-world scenarios.
