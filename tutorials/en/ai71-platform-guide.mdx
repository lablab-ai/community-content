This is perfect for teams collaborating on AI projects, providing a centralized place to manage access and resources.

## üí° Use Cases
AI71's API Hub can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

- **Customer Support**: Implementing chatbots that can handle customer inquiries and provide support.
- **Content Creation**: Generating content for blogs, social media, and marketing campaigns.
- **Data Analysis**: Automating the analysis of large datasets to derive insights.
- **Personal Assistants**: Developing virtual assistants to help with scheduling, reminders, and information retrieval.

## üîß Implementations
### Using the AI71 Python SDK
Here's a quick example of how to use the AI71 Python SDK:

First, install the SDK using pip:
```bash
pip install ai71
```

Then, you can import the library and interact with any of the models in the Python file you wish to use it in:

```python
from ai71 import AI71

AI71_API_KEY = "your AI71 API key"
client = AI71(AI71_API_KEY)

# Simple invocation
print(client.chat.completions.create(
    model="tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Artificial Intelligence?"},
    ],
))
```
> Note: Replace `<your AI71 API key>` with your actual API key. You can find or create your API key in **Api Keys** under the **Organization** section.

### Using Curl
You can also interact with the API using Curl from the terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ai71.ai/v1/chat/completions -d \
    '{
        "model": "tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat",  
        "messages": [
            {"role":"system", "content":"You are a helpful assistant."}, 
            {"role":"user", "content":"How do I tie a tie?"}
        ]
    }' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your AI71 API key>"
```

### Using Langchain SDK
To interact with the Falcon models using the langchain sdk,

First, install the SDK using pip:
```bash
pip install langchain_openai
```

Then you can import the library and interact with any of the models in the Python file you wish to use it in:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

AI71_BASE_URL = "https://api.ai71.ai/v1/"
AI71_API_KEY = "YOUR_AI71_API_KEY"

chat = ChatOpenAI(
    model="tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat",
    api_key=AI71_API_KEY,
    base_url=AI71_BASE_URL,
    streaming=True,
)

# for single use
base = chat.invoke([
    SystemMessage(content="You are MathTutor, an AI designed to help students with math problems. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions and explanations."),
    HumanMessage(content="Hi tutor, can you help me solve this quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0?"),
])
print(base.content)


# for streaming in real time
# for chunk in chat.stream("Explain Newtown's Third Law"):
#   print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Using OpenAI SDK
You can also use the OpenAI SDK to interact with the Falcon models.

First, install the SDK using pip:
```bash
pip install openai
```

Then you can import the library and interact with any of the models in the Python file you wish to use it in:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

AI71_BASE_URL = "https://api.ai71.ai/v1/"
AI71_API_KEY = "YOUR_AI71_API_KEY"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=AI71_API_KEY,
    base_url=AI71_BASE_URL,
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="tiiuae/falcon-180b-chat",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are EduTutor, an AI designed to assist with educational questions. Provide clear and helpful explanations."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi Tutor, explain pythagoras theorem"}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

## üåü Best Practices
- **Experiment with Settings**: Use the sandbox to test different models and settings to find the best fit for your application.
- **Monitor Usage**: Utilize the token calculator and usage page to keep track of your consumption and manage costs effectively.
- **Leverage Documentation**: Refer to the detailed documentation to understand the capabilities and limitations of each model.

## üéâ Conclusion
With this guide, you're ready to explore and utilize the AI71 platform to its fullest potential. From selecting and customizing models to managing your organization's resources, AI71 provides a comprehensive suite of tools for your AI projects. Happy coding! üéâ
