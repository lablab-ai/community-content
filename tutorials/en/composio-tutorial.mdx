# Leveraging Composio for Advanced Multi-Agent AI Applications

## Introduction

Hello! 👋🏽 I'm Tommy, and today we're diving into the fascinating world of AI-driven automation using the [**Composio**](https://lablab.ai/tech/composio) framework. **Composio** supercharges AI agents by allowing them to interact seamlessly with over 150 tools, making it a powerful solution for automating complex tasks with minimal effort.

In this guide, we'll explore how to harness the power of **Composio** and the [**AutoGen**](https://lablab.ai/tech/autogen) framework to create a multi-agent system that reads customer feedback from a CSV file, analyzes the data, and generates a detailed summary report in a Google Doc. Stick around to see it all come together with hands-on examples and practical insights and with a hands-on implementation in **Google Colab** at the end! 🚀

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- **Python (3.8 or higher)**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- **Conda**: We'll use a Conda environment to manage dependencies. If you don't have Conda installed, follow the installation guide [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)  
- **VS Code**: We'll be working in Visual Studio Code for managing our project files and code. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
- **Composio account**: Sign up for a free account at [Composio's official website](https://www.composio.dev) and gain access to the 150+ external tools it integrates.  
- **Groq API Key:** You can access the API key from [here](https://console.groq.com/keys) after signing up.  
- **Google account**: We'll interact with Google Docs.

## Setting Up the Environment 

Let’s get started with setting up our environment. Here’s how to do it step by step:

### Step 1: Create a Directory and Open in VS Code

First, open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. You can name the directory anything you like, but for this tutorial, we'll use `composio-test`. Then, navigate into the directory.

```bash
mkdir composio-test
cd composio-test
```

Once inside the directory, open it in Visual Studio Code by running the following command:

```bash
code .
```

This opens the current directory in VS Code.

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Conda Environment

Next, you’ll need to create a new Conda environment. This environment will house all the dependencies needed for this project. To do this, run the command below in your vscode terminal:

```bash
conda create --name composio-test python=3.11.4
```

After the environment is created, activate it:

```bash
conda activate composio-test
```

### Step 3: Create a Python File

In the VS Code directory, create a new file called `app.py`. This will serve as the main file where you’ll write the logic for your multi-agent system.

### 

### Step 4: Select the Correct Interpreter in VS Code

Make sure your VS Code is using the interpreter from the `composio-test` Conda environment. To do this:

* Open the Command Palette in VS Code (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P).  
* Search for "Python: Select Interpreter."  
* Select the interpreter that corresponds to your new Conda environment (e.g., `composio-test`).

It should show a path like `/opt/anaconda3/envs/composio-test/bin/python`.

### Step 5: Install Required Packages

Now that your environment is set up, let’s install the necessary dependencies using pip. In this case, we’ll install `composio-autogen` and `python-dotenv`:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/envs/composio-test/bin/python3 -m pip install composio-autogen python-dotenv
```

Ensure you're using the correct path to your Python interpreter from your Conda environment.

### Step 6: Log in to Composio

Once your packages are installed, you need to log in to Composio. Run the following command:

```bash
composio login
```

This will prompt you to follow the login steps, including entering a generated key.

### Step 7: Add Google Docs Tool

With Composio set up, it’s time to add the Google Docs tool since we'll be using it to generate a report later. Run the command below:

```bash
composio add googledocs
```

## Building the Multi-Agent System 

Now, we’ll build the multi-agent system using **Composio** and **AutoGen**. The system will be split into two parts to fully showcase **Composio** in action and ensure proper communication between the agents.

### Step 1: Create the CSV File

First, create a CSV file named `dummy_customer_feedback.csv` that contains customer feedback data, ratings, names, and more. Here’s an example, but feel free to modify or add more rows to suit your use case:

```csv
user_id,username,feedback,rating,date
1,user123,The app is really helpful for learning on the go!,4.5,2024-09-01
2,learner456,"Great app, but sometimes it crashes when I try to access my profile.",3.0,2024-09-01
3,student789,I love the interactive quizzes! They help me understand concepts better.,5.0,2024-09-02
4,teacher101,The app lacks advanced features for tracking student progress.,2.5,2024-09-02
5,educator202,Very user-friendly and intuitive design.,4.0,2024-09-03
```

This file will serve as the data source for analysis by our agents.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to store your API keys. You’ll need a **Groq** API key for the **LLaMA3-70B** model and a **Composio** API key, which can be found in your [Composio account settings](https://app.composio.dev/settings). The `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your-composio-api-key
```

### Step 3: Import Required Packages

Now, let's import the necessary packages in your `app.py`:

```python
from composio_autogen import ComposioToolSet, App
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager, ConversableAgent
import dotenv
from textwrap import dedent
import os
```

### Step 4: Load Environment Variables

Use the `dotenv` library to load your environment variables:

```python
dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

### Step 5: Define the LLM Configuration

Since we’re using Groq's LLaMA3-70B model, define the configuration like this:

```python
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "llama3-70b-8192",
        "api_key": os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
        "api_type": "groq",
    }
]

llm_config = {"config_list": config_list, "timeout": 300, "temperature": 0}
```

### Part One:

We create agents specifically for the task of reading, analyzing and providing a detailed summary report of key metrics gotten during analysis of a csv file containing customer feedback.

#### Step 1: Create the Data Analysis Agent

Next, define the **Data Insights Specialist** agent, which will provide a summary report of key metrics and trends after analyzing the CSV data.

```python
data_analysis_agent = ConversableAgent(
    "Data Insights Specialist",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    description=dedent("""\
        Provides Summary Report of key metrics and trends gotten 
        from data provided by the File Parser agent.
    """),
    system_message=dedent("""\
        You are a data insights specialist who analyzes data from the File Parser agent and provides a detailed summary of key metrics and trends.
        Return the summary report as context to the user agent.
    """),
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=2,
)
```

#### Step 2: Create the File Parser Agent

The  **File Parser** agent will handle reading, extracting, and formatting the CSV file’s content:

```python
da_proxy_agent = ConversableAgent(
    "File Parser and Extractor",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    description=dedent("""\
        Reads, Parses CSV files and Returns a formatted output using
        the column names in the first row of the CSV file.
    """),
    system_message=dedent("""\
        You are a file parser that reads CSV files and returns a formatted output based on the columns in the first row.
        Stop the process with the message "TERMINATE".
    """),
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=5,
)
```

#### Step 3: Create the User Agent

The **User Agent** will collect and return the final summary from the Data Insights Specialist:

```python
user_agent = UserProxyAgent(
    "User",
    description=dedent("""\
        Collects and returns the final response from the Data Insights Specialist.
    """),
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=5,
)
```

#### Step 4: Create Group Chat and Manager

Now, we’ll set up a **GroupChat** and **GroupChatManager** to facilitate communication between the agents:

```python
group_chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[data_analysis_agent, da_proxy_agent, user_agent],
    messages=[],
    send_introductions=True,
    max_round=5,
)

group_chat_manager = GroupChatManager(
    groupchat=group_chat,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

#### Step 5: Initialize the Composio Toolset

We now initialize the Composio Toolset, which provides access to all the tools available for our agents:

```python
composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet(api_key=os.getenv("COMPOSIO_API_KEY"))
```

#### Step 6: Register Tools for the Agents

We register the tools that will be used by the **File Parser** and **Data Insights Specialist** agents:

```python
composio_toolset.register_tools(
    apps=[App.FILETOOL],
    caller=data_analysis_agent,
    executor=da_proxy_agent,
)
```

By settings the apps parameter our agent has access to all the actions in the **FILETOOL** app. We can also streamline the kind of access our agent has by settings the **actions** parameter and passing the list of actions we want the agent to only have access to.

#### Step 7: Define the Task and Execute the Chat

Define the task that needs to be performed, including the CSV filename:

```python
filename = "dummy_user_feedback"
task = f"Generate a Detailed Summary report on the csv file {filename} in my current directory "

response = user_agent.initiate_chat(
   recipient=group_chat_manager,
   message=task,
   summary_method="last_msg"
)
```

Finally, retrieve the summary report provided by the Data Insights Specialist:

```python
summary_report = response.summary
```

### Part 2:

In Part Two, we'll extend the system built in Part One to write the summary report to a Google Document using **Composio** and **AutoGen**. We'll create new agents specifically for this task and utilize Google Docs tools available through Composio.

#### **Step 1: Create Agents for Google Docs Writing**

We start by defining the agents responsible for writing the summary report to a Google Document.

1. **Document Writer Agent**: This agent initiates the write operation to the Google Document.  

```python
   doc_writer_agent = AssistantAgent(  
       "Document Writer",  
       description=dedent("""  
                           Starts the write operation to a Google Document using the available tools provided.  
                           """),  
       llm_config=llm_config,  
       human_input_mode="NEVER",  
       system_message=dedent("""  
                               You are a document writer agent that writes a summary report to a Google Document using the available tools provided.  
                               """),  
       max_consecutive_auto_reply=2  
   ) 
```

2. **Content Writer Agent**: This agent is responsible for writing the content to the Google Document.  

```python
   content_writer = UserProxyAgent(
    "Content Writer",
    description="Writes content to a Google Document",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=5
    )
```

3. **User Agent**: This agent ensures the summary report is correctly written to the Google Document. 

```python
   user_agent = UserProxyAgent(
    "User",
    description=dedent("""\
                        Ensures the summary report is written to a Google Document.
                        """),
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=5
    )
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Group Chat and Manager**

We then set up a new `GroupChat` and `GroupChatManager` to coordinate these agents:

```python
group_chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[doc_writer_agent, content_writer, user_agent],
    messages=[],
    send_introductions=True,
    max_round=5
)

group_chat_manager = GroupChatManager(
    groupchat=group_chat,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

#### **Step 3: Register the Google Docs Tool**

Next, we register the Google Docs tool in Composio for our agents:

```python
composio_toolset.register_tools(
    apps=[App.GOOGLEDOCS],
    caller=doc_writer_agent,
    executor=content_writer,
)
```

#### **Step 4: Write the Summary to Google Docs**

Now, we initiate the chat where the summary report generated in Part One is written to a Google Document titled `"User Feedback Report"`:

```python
res2 = user_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=group_chat_manager,
    message=f"Write the summary report '{summary_report}' to a Google Document named 'User Feedback Report'.",
)
```

## Running the Python File

Now that our multi-agent system is fully set up, it's time to see it in action! We'll execute our Python script using the terminal in VSCode to observe the magic unfold.

 In your VSCode terminal, ensure you're in the root directory where your `app.py` file is located. Then, execute the script by running:

```python
/opt/anaconda3/envs/composio-test/bin/python3 app.py
```

Ensure you’re using the path to your conda environment

## Review Execution Flow

Once you run your Python file, the logs for each agent and tool should be visible, as verbosity is enabled by default. Now, let’s see the power of Composio tooling in action.

You should see all the tools available in FILETOOL, with the Data Insights Specialist Agent suggesting tool actions to perform based on the task.

The agent then delegates the execution to the FILE PARSER and EXTRACTOR agent, which we defined earlier as the executor for the FILETOOL.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/d2b3202f-ddb2-4368-847d-bd450370a900/full" alt="File Parser in action" caption="Executing suggested tool calls" />

After the Extractor agent executes all the suggested tool calls by the Data Specialist agent, it returns all the fields in the CSV file in a formatted way.

Next, the User Agent kicks off by passing the summary report provided by the Data Specialist Agent to the Group Chat Manager, which then calls the Document Writer Agent.  

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/ed0b314c-7ad8-4078-039d-a409201e9900/full" alt="pass summary to next group chat" caption="pass summary to next group chat" />

The Document Writer agent, armed with all actions for interacting with Google Docs, now suggests tool calls for the Content Writer Agent to perform.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/11852e36-5596-403f-02c9-e9f188ac6700/full" alt="Document Agent suggesting tool call" caption="Document Agent suggesting tool call" />

The Content Writer Agent then starts execution and writes the summary to the Google document as defined by the Document Writer Agent.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/74a41e7e-78dc-48c0-fcce-147b5c1e9a00/full" alt="Writer Agent executing tool call" caption="Writer Agent executing tool call" />

After execution, check your Google Drive recents, and you should see the file named 'User Feedback Report' with the summary report.

## Next Steps: Expanding Your Use of Composio

Now that you’ve successfully built and run a multi-agent system with Composio, there are several exciting avenues to explore next:

1. **Utilizing Triggers for Automated Actions**: Triggers are a powerful feature in Composio that can automate workflows based on specific events or conditions. You can set up triggers to initiate actions automatically when certain criteria are met, like sending notifications, updating databases, or executing specific tasks in response to changes in your data. This can make your multi-agent system even more responsive and autonomous, reducing the need for manual intervention.  
2. **Integrating Additional Tools and APIs**: Composio supports a wide range of tools and APIs that you can integrate into your system. For instance, you could add tools for social media analytics, database management, or cloud storage, enabling your agents to perform even more diverse tasks. Exploring the Composio marketplace will give you ideas on expanding your system’s capabilities.  
3. **Exploring Advanced Agent Interactions**: While this tutorial focused on a straightforward multi-agent setup, Composio allows for much more complex agent interactions. You could experiment with hierarchical agent structures, where certain agents manage or oversee others, or explore cooperative learning, where agents share knowledge to improve performance over time.  
4. **Expanding to Other AI Models**: Although you used the Groq Llama3-70b model in this tutorial, Composio supports various AI models. You could experiment with different models or even integrate custom-trained models to tailor your agents' performance to specific needs.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored building a multi-agent system using **Composio** and **AutoGen**, focusing on analyzing customer feedback from a CSV file and generating a summary report. We walked through setting up the environment, configuring the agents, and using tools to read and analyze data, followed by writing the summary to a Google document. This process demonstrated how Composio can be leveraged for complex workflows involving multiple agents while ensuring proper context and coordination.

During the project, I encountered challenges with the OpenAI API and retrieving summary reports in a single step. To overcome these issues, I switched to using the Groq API and split the process into two parts, which successfully achieved the desired outcome. These experiences highlighted both the flexibility of Composio and the importance of troubleshooting and adapting when working with new tools and frameworks.

Composio's vast array of tools and easy integration make it a powerful choice for developers looking to enhance their projects with AI capabilities. I encourage you to explore **Composio** further by checking out the [official documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview). There's a lot more to discover, and I'm excited to continue experimenting with this versatile framework.

Happy coding! 🎉
