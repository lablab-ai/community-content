# Create an Information Retrieval Chatbot with AI Agents

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a sophisticated chatbot for information retrieval using AI agents. Explore the steps to harness the power of AI in building a chatbot that can efficiently retrieve data from various sources.

## Setting Up the Environment

Our plan will be to create a chatbot using AI Agents ([LangChain](https://lablab.ai/tech/langchain)), with a simple UI using [chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit).

We would like our chatbot to be able to respond to a query in two stages: planning and retrieval, Agent should have access to Wikipedia and Web Search. This will be our task!

### Preparation & depedencies

Let's start by creating a new project. I will start with creating new directory:

```bash
mkdir agents-chatbot
cd agents-chatbot
```

Let's create virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# Linux/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

pip install langchain chainlit python-dotenv wikipedia duckduckgo-search
```

Now we can create our `app.py` file (name is required by chainlit):

```bash
touch app.py
```

Last step is to import our dependencies:

```python
import os

import chainlit as cl
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain import PromptTemplate
from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

load_dotenv()

# OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

_Disclaimer: I defined my environment variables in `.env`, you can do the same or define secrets in code._

### Coding

Now is time to initialize out LLM and Tools. I will use GPT-4 for this tutorial, but you can use a different model if you want. I will also use `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` and `WikipediaAPIWrapper` as my tools.

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")

search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
wikipedia = WikipediaAPIWrapper()

# Web Search Tool
search_tool = Tool(
    name="Web Search",
    func=search.run,
    description="A useful tool for searching the Internet to find information on world events, issues, etc. Worth using for general topics. Use precise questions.",
)

# Wikipedia Tool
wikipedia_tool = Tool(
    name="Wikipedia",
    func=wikipedia.run,
    description="A useful tool for searching the Internet to find information on world events, issues, etc. Worth using for general topics. Use precise questions.",
)
```

The next step is to prepare PromptTemplates. I will prepare two. One for the planning process and one for the process of generating the final response.

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""Plan: {input}

History: {chat_history}

Let's think about answer step by step.
If it's information retrieval task, solve it like a professor in particular field.""",
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history"],
)

plan_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history"],
    template="""Prepare plan for task execution. (e.g. retrieve current date to find weather forecast)

    Tools to use: wikipedia, web search

    REMEMBER: Keep in mind that you don't have information about current date, temperature, informations after September 2021. Because of that you need to use tools to find them.

    Question: {input}

    History: {chat_history}

    Output look like this:
    '''
        Question: {input}

        Execution plan: [execution_plan]

        Rest of needed information: [rest_of_needed_information]
    '''

    IMPORTANT: if there is no question, or plan is not need (YOU HAVE TO DECIDE!), just populate {input} (pass it as a result). Then output should look like this:
    '''
        input: {input}
    '''
    """,
)
```

Now is the time to initiate the Agent and Planning Chain. Also, I will add memory so they can save information about previous messages.

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)


plan_chain = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    input_key="input",
    prompt=plan_prompt,
    output_key="output",
)

# Initialize Agent
agent = initialize_agent(
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    tools=[search_tool, wikipedia_tool],
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True, # verbose option is for printing logs (only for development)
    max_iterations=3,
    prompt=prompt,
    memory=memory,
)
```

### UI part

Now is time to create UI. I will use chainlit for this purpose. I will utilize `factory` function to pass our agent to chainlit. But before triggering `factory` function chainlit uses `run` function to prepare pipeline of passing input to model. I will overwrite it to change flow a little bit. I want to firstly execute planning and then to generate response. Let's do it!

```python
@cl.langchain_run
def run(agent, input_str):
    # Plan execution
    plan_result = plan_chain.run(input_str)

    # Agent execution
    res = agent(plan_result)

    # Send message
    cl.Message(content=res["output"]).send()


@cl.langchain_factory
def factory():
    return agent
```

Okay, we are almost done. Last step is to run our app!

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w # -w flag is for restarting app after each change
```

## Results!

Great, now let's test our application. I will start our application by saying hello and then ask it a question. Let's see what the result will be!

## Bravo! Let's Dive Deeper

Marvelous! As you witnessed initially, the model bypassed planning until prompted – then, it organized tasks and crafted a response just as intended!
