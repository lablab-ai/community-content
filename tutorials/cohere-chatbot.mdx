Cohere provides natural language processing models that help companies improve human-machine interactions. It offers a clear way of understanding the world around us by providing dynamic and contextual information.

In this tutorial, we create the chatbot with cohere as a heart. You can see different [Cohere tutorial](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-in-depth-sentiment-analysis-of-reviews)

Before we have started with coding, you need to create an account on [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) to get the API key.

## Cohere

To use cohere we need to install it
```Python
pip install cohere
```

Then we can use cohere in our code. In this tutorial, we use generate method. Entire docs for it you can found [here](https://docs.cohere.ai/).
First, we have to initialize the client, I will also create a class `CoHere`.

In arguments of Client should be API key, which you have generated before, and version `2021-11-08`.

```Python
class CoHere:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.co = cohere.Client(f'{api_key}', '2021-11-08')
```

Now, we should create a method to generate a text. We have to select a few arguments of cohere method. 

`model` size of the model

`prompt` "instructions" for model, we use `stevenQa` function for it. 

`max_tokens` is the max length of output

`temperature` is the degree of randomness

More avaiable arguments are [here](https://docs.cohere.ai/generate-reference)

```Python
    def cohere(self, question):
        return self.co.generate(
              model='medium',
              prompt=stevenQa(question),
              max_tokens=50,
              temperature=1).generations[0].text
```

### Prompt

After that, we have to write a prompt for our model. The prompt is instructions and some examples. In brackets `{question}` will be new question. 

```Python
def stevenAa(question):
    return f'''Steven is a chatbot that answers questions:

You: Who is better Pepsi or Coca-cola?
Steven: More people know that if they want to drink on the go, they should bring their own Coke
You: Where is the best restaurant?
Steven: Mexican and Chinese restaurant.
You: Which search engine is best?
Steven: Google search for best.
You: Do you like jazz?
Steven: I prefer to listen to jazz in the '80s.
You: {question}
Steven:'''
```

## Streamlit

Streamlit is a great tool to build a simple web app.

Installation
```Python
pip install streamlit
```

In this tutorial, we will build an app with two text inputs and a button to display the cohere result.

From docs of [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) I will take four methods of streamlit

`st.header()` to make a header on our app

`st.test_input()` to send a text request

`st.button()` to create button

`st.write()` to display the results of cohere model.


```Python
import streamlit as st

st.header("Co:here application")

api_key = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key:", type="password")

st.header("Your personal chat bot - Steven")

question_for_steven = st.text_input("Question for Steven:")

cohere = CoHere(api_key)

if st.button("Answer"):
    st.write(cohere.cohere(question_for_steven))
```

To run the streamlit app use command
```Python
streamlit run name_of_your_file.py
```

The created app looks like this

## Conclusion

The Cohere models are so powerful, that this tutorial shows only one usage of cohere model. Cohere is also able to embed and classify text. In my mind, there are a lot of ideas on how to use NLP models from cohere. 

Stay tuned for future tutorials!
