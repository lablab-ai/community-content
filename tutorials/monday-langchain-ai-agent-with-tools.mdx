## Let's make an AI agent!

In this tutorial, we will cover how to use LangChain with Monday.com API to create a conversational AI agent that can add items to Monday.com. We'll walk through the process step-by-step, starting with installing necessary packages and ending with testing the agent's ability to add items to a Monday.com board.

### 1. Introduction 

Web automations are getting more advanced. One such implementation is to create conversational AI agents that can add tasks to project management tools like Monday.com by simply sending a message to the agent. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the process of creating such an AI agent using LangChain and Monday.com API.

### 2. Installing Packages 

First, we need to install the required packages `langchain` and `openai`. To do this, run the following command in your Python environment:

```
!pip install langchain openai
```

### 3. Importing Necessary Components 

Next, import the required components for this tutorial.

```python
from langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool
import requests
import json
```

### 4. Setting up OpenAI

Now, set up a `ChatOpenAI` object to train our AI agent using the GPT-3.5 model from OpenAI.

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

### 5. Creating a Function to Add Items in Monday.com <a name="creating-function"></a>

In this step, we'll create a function called `add_Item` that uses the Monday.com API and takes a query as input. This query represents the name of the item we want to add to the board in Monday.com.

Make sure to replace `your_monday_com_api_key` with your actual Monday.com API key:

```python
url = "https://api.monday.com/v2"

headers = {
  'Authorization': 'your_monday_com_api_key',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

def add_Item(query: str) -> str:

    payload = json.dumps({
        "query": f"mutation {{create_item (board_id: 123, group_id: \"topics\", item_name: \"{query}\") {{id}}}}"
    })

    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return "Item added successfully"
    else:
        return f"Request failed: {response.text}"
```

### 6. Defining a Tool to Add Items to Monday.com 

Now, define a Tool that uses the `add_Item` function to add items to Monday.com. This Tool can be used by the AI agent we'll create later:

```python
tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        func=add_Item,
        name="Add Item to Monday.com",
        description="Useful for when you need to add a new item to Monday, input is the name of the new item",
    ),
]
```

### 7. Initializing the Agent 

It's time to initialize the AI agent with the tools we prepared earlier. We'll use the `initialize_agent` function to create an AI agent capable of performing our desired action:

```python
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```

### 8. Testing the Agent with Adding Items to Monday.com 

Finally, to test our AI agent, we'll run the following command that instructs the agent to add a new item with the name "buy peanut butter (api test)" to Monday.com:

```python
agent.run("add buy peanutbutter to monday.com")
```

If everything works as expected, you should see an output similar to:

```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I need to use the 'Add Item to Monday.com' tool to add this task to the board.
Action: Add Item to Monday.com
Action Input: 'buy peanutbutter'
Observation: Item added successfully
```

With this, you have successfully created a conversational AI agent that can add items to a Monday.com board.

Remember to replace `your_openai_api_key` and `your_monday_com_api_key` with your corresponding API keys, and update the `board_id` and `group_id` in the `add_Item` function as necessary to match your specific Monday.com configuration.

You could now add more tools to create boards, delete items or much much more! Check out the [Monday API docs](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/mondayapi) for fore functionalities. The [API Playground](https://monday.com/developers/v2/try-it-yourself) is also great to test out your ideas.
