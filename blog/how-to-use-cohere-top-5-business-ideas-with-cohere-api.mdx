### Cross-lingual zero-shot content moderation

It might be difficult to find damaging content in online global networks. Social networking sites and other online communities frequently include a wide range of users who come from many cultures and speak various languages. As a result, it is challenging to detect hazardous content because doing so would require human experts who are proficient in each of these languages.

A multilingual model created by Cohere can [identify dangerous content](https://cohere.ai/use-case-toxic-language) in more than 100 languages. The model is trained using a small number of English examples. These allow it to learn what constitutes objectionable material, which it can then apply to other languages. This enables the rapid and precise detection of hazardous content in online communities around the world, regardless of the language being spoken.

### Aggregate customer’s feedback

The multilingual model from Cohere is a potent tool for making the difficult task of organizing client input across hundreds of languages more manageable. To process client feedback from a variety of languages and create language-neutral models, the model is trained using natural language processing (NLP) methods. It is consequently much simpler to gather and [evaluate consumer feedback](https://cohere.ai/use-case-customer-support) across many languages when these algorithms are used to automatically classify customer feedback into pertinent categories. The methodology can also be used to find language-specific trends and patterns in customer feedback, providing businesses with knowledge on how individuals from other nations and cultures engage with their goods and services. Cohere's multilingual approach can be an invaluable tool for multinational operations because it can process client input in different languages fast and accurately.

### Multilingual semantic search

Regardless of the language used in the search query or the source content, Cohere is a multilingual search engine that uses machine learning and natural language processing to produce quick, precise search results. By more accurately interpreting the context and meaning of a question, the technology is intended to increase the quality of search results. In order to deliver pertinent results in several languages, Cohere's algorithms are built to recognize the relationships between words and sentences as well as the variations between languages. To aid customers in finding the information they need fast, Cohere also offers sophisticated tools like auto-complete, spelling checks, and synonym suggestions. Cohere can give quicker, more accurate search results regardless of the language used by utilizing the power of AI and NLP. We have a dedicated [Cohere tutoria](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-semantic-search)l regarding Semantic search.

### Intent recognition

Having a conversation with a chatbot might be difficult, especially if we don't ask the right kind of questions. By enabling the [chatbot](https://cohere.ai/use-case-intent-recognition) to comprehend the underlying meaning behind a user's statement or the tone of the response, natural language processing (NLP) can assist in bridging the communication gap.

Enter Cohere, a technology built on NLP that enables chatbot apps to comprehend the meaning of a user's sentence and decipher the tone of their response. Thanks to this technology, the chatbot can more precisely and quickly assess the needs of the user. Customers benefit from faster and more accurate answers to their questions, which improves everyone's user experience.

### Content generation

A strong language model called [Generate](https://cohere.ai/generate) has been trained on trillions of words of text, which helps it comprehend the linguistic intricacies and patterns. It generates content, forecasts outcomes, and provides answers using this information. The technology behind Generate is intended to make it possible for users to produce content more quickly, precisely, and consistently than ever before. It can be used to deliver insights into complex data sets and quickly generate text, headlines, or entire articles from a list of keywords or concepts. Because Generate is designed utilizing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing methods, it can swiftly acquire data, process it, and adapt to different kinds of material.
