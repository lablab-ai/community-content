# Lablab.ai is a community of creators, builders and innovators. 

We support the development of the blooming AI industry. We organize [AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event), where we want to connect like-minded people and with support of our mentors assist them in creating working AI based apps. To help the community to grow we also publish [reports](https://newnative.ai/news/the-ai-economy-and-future-of-ai-natives) for everyone to have access to data regarding the potential of AI in tech.

We also want to promote the shift in the creative industry. With Dall-e, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and many other tools we are witnessing the revolution in work of artists and designers on a scale never seen before!

That’s why we organized the First AI art competition, as a part of the [Stable Diffusion AI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon)!

We received many interesting artworks, created with Midjourney, DALLE-E or Stable Diffusion. We of course, accepted only submission with artworks created with generative AI.


## So, we would like to present the winner of the 1st AI art competition: 
Julia Shutkevych and the winning work “To live is to love” created with Stable Diffusion Deforum Notebook Google Collab

Short insight into Julia’s generated AI art practice:

> *Regarding AI creation process I'm using google collab stable diffusion notebooks, upscaling tools, DALLE, Midjourney as well as generative art (Touchdesigner) and code art (Processing, p5.js). I'm inspired by everything I see and experience daily. Taking photos, observing nature and finding textures are endless sources of new ideas for me. Another thing that stimulates my art process is walking and listening to music, it's my way of meditating.*
