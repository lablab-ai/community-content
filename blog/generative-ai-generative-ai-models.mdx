## What are generative AI models?

Generative AI models are a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data from existing sources. These models are important for creating data that can be used for research, development, and business applications. In this article, we'll discuss what generative AI models are, where they can be used, and why they are so important.

Also if you want to see how AI transformers (generative AI) changes the world, you can read our previous [generative AI models](https://lablab.ai/blog/generative-ai-ai-transformers) article.

Generative AI models are algorithms that use existing data to generate new data. This data is usually in the form of images, text, or other forms of digital media. Generative models can be used to create realistic data from existing sources, such as images from a photo library or text from a book. This generated data can be used to train other AI models, such as computer vision models or natural language processing models.


## Where can I use generative AI models?

Generative AI models can be used in a variety of applications. For example, they can be used to create realistic images or videos to be used in computer vision applications. They can also be used to generate natural language text to be used in natural language processing applications. Generative AI models can also be used to generate realistic data for medical applications, such as creating medical images or text-based medical records. If you want to see perfect examples of apps you can create using generative AI models, see the submitted (and of course winning) project from our [previous AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event).


## Why should I use generative AI models?

Generative AI models are important as they can help us better understand the data we are generating. They can also help us create more realistic and accurate data for our applications. Generative models can help us generate more data faster, which can lead to faster and more accurate AI models.

Generative AI models are an important tool in the AI world and are becoming more widely used in various applications. They can help us create more realistic data, faster and more accurately, which can help advance our AI applications and research. Generative AI models are changing the way we generate and use data, and are an important part of advancing AI technology.
