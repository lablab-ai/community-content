New breakthrough from Cohere - Multilingual Text Understanding Model!

If you went offline for the last 24 hours you might have missed it, but don’t worry - lablab.ai team gots you covered. So, on 12th December 2022 Cohere released a new, [multilingual model](https://txt.cohere.ai/multilingual/). Long story short - it’s the industry’s first multilingual text understanding model that supports 100+ languages. It also delivers 3 times better performance than existing open-source models. We all know what it means - a better tool to serve users all over the world.

And with [Cohere’s Semantic Search AI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon) round the corner (16-23 December) we would like to give you some examples of how you can use this cutting-edge technology to benefit your AI Hackathon project and create a working prototype for your upcoming million dollar startup!

## So… how can I use a Multilingual Text Understanding Model in my AI Hackathon?

1. Machine Translation: Quickly and accurately translate multilingual text into any language.

2. Text Analytics: Automatically extract insights from multilingual text.

3. Natural Language Processing: Identify parts of speech, entities, and other natural language components from multilingual text.

4. Language Identification: Automatically identify the language of multilingual text.

5. Text Generation: Generate natural-sounding and high-quality text in any language.
