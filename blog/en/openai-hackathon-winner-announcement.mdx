## OpenAI Hackathon is over, and the results are in!

First of all, lablab.ai team would love to thank the sponsors of our amazing Hackathon - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for supporting the event and providing $2000 in Digital Ocean credits to be distributed among the winning teams!

Second of all, we would like to thank amazing 2653 participants for their devotion into innovating, creating and building something great with OpenAI Whisper, GPT-3, Codex, or DALL-E 2 APIs. 259 teams submitted 54 projects, but sadly there can be only 1 winner. So without any further ado, big shout out to the winning projects!

### 🥇First place

The main prize goes to [kiwi video](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon/slates/kiwi-video), a powerful tool, which allows you to learn from videos with AI! 

The main concept behind the project was that watching online lectures is convenient, but makes it hard to engage with the material. That’s why with the usage of GPT-3 and Whisper, an AI assistant, that answers your questions about the video and tests your understanding with AI- generated quizzes!

Congratulations to the team and if you want to know more about the project, check out the project website and feel free to reach out to the team members!
