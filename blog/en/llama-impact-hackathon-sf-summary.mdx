Over the event, teams built 83 cutting-edge AI applications, showcasing the potential of Llama 3.2‚Äôs multimodal capabilities, which process both text and images, and its lightweight, edge-friendly design. The on-site portion of the event, hosted at the [MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) venue and organized by lablab.ai, offered exclusive access to mentors, collaborative opportunities, and hands-on support.

Whether online or in person, the Llama Impact Hackathon was a testament to the transformative power of community-driven innovation and the limitless possibilities of next-generation AI. ‚ú®


## **üåü Hackathon Challenge**

This Hackathon challenged participants to tackle pressing real-world issues using Meta‚Äôs advanced Llama models. As part of the global Llama 3.1 Impact Grant series, the hackathon offered participants the chance to showcase their skills and align their projects with impactful initiatives.

The Llama Impact Hackathon tasked participants with addressing three critical real-world challenges using Meta‚Äôs advanced Llama models:

1. **Expanding Low-Resource Languages**

Many languages lack adequate AI support, limiting accessibility and cultural relevance. Participants were challenged to develop AI solutions using Llama to support low-resource languages, ensuring these models are culturally sensitive and locally relevant.

2. **Reducing Barriers for Llama Developers**

Developing with Llama can be complex due to challenges in data preparation and evaluation. This challenge called on participants to create tools that simplify the development process, including improving prompt engineering, streamlining data workflows, and enhancing model evaluation.

3. **Navigating Public Services**

Government services are often difficult to access and understand, creating barriers for citizens. Teams were tasked with using Llama to create chatbots or AI assistants to simplify tasks like navigating government websites, tax filing, accessing benefits, and streamlining permitting or grant-writing processes.
