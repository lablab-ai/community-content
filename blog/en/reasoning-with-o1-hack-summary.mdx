## **Event Overview**

[Reasoning with o1 Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/strawberry-reasoning-with-o1) saw 864 participants across 208 teams develop 41 innovative AI applications, showcasing the power of the o1 models. These models, including o1-preview and o1-mini, excel in multi-step reasoning, particularly in STEM fields like coding and scientific analysis.

o1-preview, with its broader knowledge base, was utilized for complex problem-solving across industries, while o1-mini offered a faster, cost-efficient solution for STEM tasks, ideal for real-time and resource-constrained environments. The hackathon highlighted the models' strengths in efficiency, safety, and robustness, demonstrating their potential to transform AI-driven problem-solving across a range of applications.


## **üåü Hackathon Challenge**

The challenge for the Reasoning with o1 Hackathon tasked participants with developing an AI-driven tool that leverages the deep reasoning capabilities of the OpenAI o1 or o1-mini models. The goal was to automate decision-making or problem-solving in real-world contexts, utilizing the models‚Äô strengths in breaking down complex, multi-step problems. Participants were encouraged to create innovative solutions that could make a meaningful impact in areas such as STEM, law, or scientific research, or explore other fields where AI-driven reasoning could address real-world challenges. The key requirements emphasized using o1's reasoning power to ensure practical, scalable solutions with tangible real-world impact.


## **ü§ù Partners and Technologies**
A huge thank you to our partner AI/ML API for providing exclusive FREE access to OpenAI's o1 models to approved hackathon participants! üöÄ We offered 1,000 keys, each with $20 in AI/ML API credits, giving participants the opportunity to access o1-preview and o1-mini models and supercharge their AI projects during the free subscription week.

With these credits, participants unlocked over 100 models, including OpenAI o1 & o1-mini, LLama, Qwen, and Flux, covering everything from image generation to computer vision, all through a single API. This support ensured teams had the resources they needed to build something extraordinary. 


## **üèÜ Prizes and Opportunities**
Top-performing teams will secure fast-track interviews for the prestigious NEXT acceleration program, a 6-week intensive designed to help startups take their prototypes and MVPs to market. Participants will receive personalized mentorship from industry experts, refining their ideas and overcoming the hurdles of launching a successful venture. Along with expert guidance, teams will craft a solid go-to-market strategy, expand their professional networks, and gain access to essential tools, resources, and templates. This opportunity offers the perfect springboard for innovators ready to make their mark in the competitive business world. üöÄ
