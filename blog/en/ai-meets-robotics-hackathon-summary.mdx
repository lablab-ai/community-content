## **Event Overview**

The integration of artificial intelligence and physical robotics is one of the most exciting frontiers in modern technology. From **February 6–15, 2026**, the **Launch & Fund: AI Meets Robotics** hackathon brought together a global community of innovators to push the boundaries of what's possible.

Hosted on [LabLab.ai](https://lablab.ai/), this event saw an incredible turnout of **4,410 registered participants across 357 teams**. Builders were challenged to develop AI-powered robotics solutions with a "simulation-first" mindset, leveraging **Google Gemini** models to create intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## **A Simulation-First Vision**

The hackathon emphasized the importance of high-fidelity simulations as a prerequisite for real-world robotics deployment. By using tools like **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** or **Webots** alongside Gemini's multimodal reasoning, participants built agents capable of handling complex tasks, from autonomous fleet dispatch to robotized e-commerce fulfillment.

This "Launch & Fund" edition wasn't just about technical demos; it was about building the foundation for new startups. With over **$1,000,000 in prizes and credits** on the line, the focus was on scalability, safety, and real-world applicability. Teams explored how AI agents can serve as the "brain" for hardware, interpreting complex environments and executing tasks with sub-second decision-making.

## **From Global Talent to Industry-Ready Prototypes**

The sheer scale of participation highlights the massive interest in this field. Builders from across the globe collaborated online to submit **96 functional AI applications**. The intensity of the 10-day sprint pushed teams to go from conceptual ideas to working simulated prototypes, proving that the barrier to entry for robotics is lowering thanks to AI-driven simulation.

The quality of submissions was so high that judges noted several projects as being ready for immediate incubation. The event served as a launchpad for the next generation of robotics entrepreneurs, connecting them with mentors and potential funding through the GAIA and Slingshot programs.
