# Qubic's Ecosystem Growth Through LabLab Partnership: From Hybrid Activation to Dedicated Hackathon Success

## Introduction
Qubic is a high-performance blockchain built for speed, scalability, and real-world integrations. Its unique computational model allows developers to run decentralized applications and smart contracts with deterministic execution and efficient consensus - bringing scalable computation to Web3.

Qubic partnered with LabLab for a hackathon to attract builders, validate use cases, and drive adoption, starting with an initial track and scaling to a full event.

## Phase 1 – Raise Your Hack (Hybrid Hackathon)
[Raise Your Hack](https://lablab.ai/event/raise-your-hack) was a hybrid event blending online and on-site participation, held in Paris in 2025. It featured multiple partner tracks, including Qubic's dedicated focus on smart contract security and development tools.

In the Qubic track, builders explored the network's smart contracts, creating auditing platforms, decentralized marketplaces, and integration tools. The track saw several submissions, with projects addressing vulnerabilities, testing, and ecosystem accessibility.

### Winning Team & Growth Story
[Team Kairos](https://lablab.ai/blog/the-kairos-story-at-raise) won the Qubic track with QBuild, a one-click auditing tool that identifies vulnerabilities, generates reports, and creates test sets for smart contracts.

Formed from a merger of Web3 teams, Kairos started in a prior Qubic hackathon in Madrid, securing second place with EasyConnect—a no-code integration platform now in incubation.

Their Raise Your Hack victory, including first place and the X Audience Choice Award, validated their approach. Post-event, Kairos continued developing QBuild toward incubation. This growth culminated in launching their own EasyConnect track in [a subsequent hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/qubic-hack-the-future), enabling no-code builders to create automations and bridges for Qubic. This progression shows how LabLab hackathons foster long-term project evolution and ecosystem leadership.

## Phase 2 – Qubic Hack the Future (Fully Online, Dedicated)
[Qubic Hack the Future](https://lablab.ai/event/qubic-hack-the-future) shifted to a fully online, Qubic-exclusive format from December 5–7, 2025. This allowed global participation without travel, focusing entirely on Qubic's infrastructure.

The event featured two tracks: Nostromo for advanced DeFi and infrastructure builds, and EasyConnect for no-code automations. Challenges aligned with Qubic's roadmap and community vision, emphasizing secure, scalable applications.

## Long-Term Value & Takeaways
The partnership demonstrates a clear evolution path: **from hybrid → fully online → fully dedicated**. Starting with a track in Raise Your Hack validated initial interest and market fit. Scaling to Qubic Hack the Future as a fully online, dedicated event enabled global participation and significantly increased outputs—from initial submissions to 96 AI applications built by 265 teams.

**From track participant → ecosystem leader**: Kairos's journey exemplifies this transformation. Beginning as winners in Raise Your Hack, they evolved into track leaders, launching their own EasyConnect track in Qubic Hack the Future. This progression from participant to ecosystem contributor shows how LabLab hackathons create pathways for sustained growth and leadership development.

**From experimentation → repeatable growth engine**: The partnership has transformed hackathons from one-off experiments into a repeatable infrastructure for talent acquisition, tech adoption, and ecosystem expansion. The measurable outcomes—1,654 participants, 265 teams, 96 applications, top 10 social ranking—demonstrate scalability and impact.

This progression positions hackathons as **long-term infrastructure** for:
- **Talent acquisition**: Attracting motivated builders from emerging markets and diverse technical backgrounds
- **Tech adoption**: Validating use cases and driving real-world implementations on Qubic's infrastructure
- **Ecosystem expansion**: Fostering projects that continue beyond the event, with winners like Kairos becoming ecosystem leaders

By turning experiments into repeatable drivers of innovation and visibility, the partnership has established a sustainable model for ecosystem growth that extends far beyond individual events.
