This tutorial outlines the essential steps to follow, from initial registration to final project submission, ensuring you have a smooth and successful hackathon journey.

### 1. Understanding the Hackathon Process

To effectively participate, it's crucial to understand the typical flow of a hackathon. Generally, it involves several key stages designed to guide you through the process of developing and presenting your project.

#### Steps to Follow:
1. Complete your lablab.ai profile.
2. Register for the hackathon.
3. Connect your Discord account.
4. Create or join a team.
5. Submit your project.

### 2. Signing Up for the Hackathon

The first official step is to enroll in your chosen hackathon. Navigate to the hackathon's specific URL on lablab.ai.

#### How to Find/Join a Team:
If you're looking for teammates, there are two primary methods:
1.  **Browse Existing Teams:** Scroll down the hackathon page and look for teams displaying the "looking for members" badge. Navigate to their dashboard and use the chat function to see if there's a good match for your skills and interests.
2.  **Discord Channel:** Join the dedicated Discord server for the hackathon and check the `#looking-for-team` channel. Post a message introducing yourself and your skills, or respond to existing requests.

### 4. Submitting Your Project

After all your hard work in developing your solution, the final step is to submit your project. This involves providing detailed information about your application.

Scroll down the hackathon page and click on the "Submit project" button.
