### Building Healthcare Solutions with AI

Sanjitha Mohammad and her team participated in the AI Genesis Hackathon 2025, where they developed **NovaHealth**, a Preventive Health Intelligence System for smarter, data-driven public health planning using Opus. This AI-powered solution is designed to shift healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. The system analyzes anonymized data from clinics, pharmacies, and public surveys, cleans and standardizes it, removes PII, and performs regional risk analysis to generate regional forecasts, targeted intervention plans, public health alerts, and compliance and risk summary reports.

> "Huge thanks to the organizers, mentors, and judges for the guidance and inspiration throughout the event. This experience strengthened our teamwork, problem-solving, and AI automation skills and I'm excited to keep building solutions that create real impact." — [Sanjitha Mohammad](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7399478413436190721/?actorCompanyId=80107028)

### The Power of Determination and Accountability

Linford Musiyambodza shared an inspiring story of determination and resilience during the hackathon. Despite facing numerous challenges, including learning a completely new platform (IBM Orchestrate/watsonx) with zero prior experience and juggling multiple responsibilities, he successfully built an AI agent that automates support ticket routing using Slack.

> "This weekend, I participated in a 48-hour hackathon with lablab.ai, and it was intense. You might ask: 'Linford, how do you manage all of this?' One day, I'll share my full story. But here's what I know: accountability starts with me. That's why I usually work solo during hackathons - most people disappear when the pressure hits." — [Linford Musiyambodza](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398511016071913473/?actorCompanyId=80107028)
