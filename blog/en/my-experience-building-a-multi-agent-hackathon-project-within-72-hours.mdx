# My Experience Building a Multi Agent Hackathon Project Within 72 Hours

## TL;DR

I recently participated in a hackathon project called "**AI Agents on Arc with USDC**" organized by [**lablab.ai**](https://lablab.ai/). My project name is **Arc Mind Collective** which brings AI-powered intelligence to blockchain intent coordination using 5 specialized agents (supported by Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Gemini 2.5 Pro) orchestrated with LangGraph, deployed on Arc L1 testnet with full smart contract settlement.

## The Problem: Why Blockchain Needs to Get Smarter

I've been fascinated by intent-based architectures ever since Uniswap X and CoW Protocol started gaining traction. The idea is simple but powerful: instead of manually crafting complex transactions, users express their _intent_ ("I want to buy 1 BTC with USDC at the best price") and let the protocol figure out the execution.

But here's the thing that kept bothering me: **these systems can't actually think**.

Current intent coordination platforms are basically sophisticated matching engines - they can compare numbers and execute predefined rules, but they fundamentally lack:

1. **Semantic understanding** - They can't understand context or nuanced requirements
2. **Risk awareness** - No built-in fraud detection or counterparty risk assessment
3. **Market intelligence** - No real-time validation of whether prices make sense
4. **Explainability** - Decisions are opaque black boxes

This is where AI and blockchain should merge. Smart contracts are perfect for trustless execution, but they need intelligence for coordination, analysis, and decision-making.

## The Idea: Five AI Agents Working as a Team

During the Arc L1 hackathon, I set out to build what I believe is the **first multi-agent AI system for decentralized intent coordination**. The architecture is inspired by how humans work in trading desks - different specialists handling different aspects:

### The Five Agents

**🎯 Matching Agent** (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

- Semantic understanding of buy/sell intents
- Finds optimal counterparties with confidence scoring
- Can handle complex requirements like "verified sellers only" or "must settle within 1 hour"

**📈 Market Agent** (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

- Real-time price validation against market conditions
- Volatility analysis and sentiment scoring
- Ensures users aren't getting ripped off

**🛡️ Fraud Agent** (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

- Pattern detection for wash trading, pump-and-dump schemes
- Historical behavior analysis
- Flags suspicious activity before settlement

**⚠️ Risk Agent** (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

- Comprehensive risk scoring across multiple dimensions
- Counterparty risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk
- Explainable decisions with reasoning

**💳 Settlement Agent** (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

- Plans atomic escrow settlement on Arc L1
- Gas estimation and optimization
- Coordinates with PaymentRouter for AP2 (Stripe) integration

## The Build: From Concept to Production in 72 Hours

### Night 1: Architecture & Smart Contracts

I started with the blockchain layer - three Solidity contracts that would handle the on-chain settlement:

> _// Core contracts deployed to Arc testnet_
>
> _IntentRegistry.sol - Stores all trading intents (182 LOC)_
>
> _AuctionEscrow.sol - Manages matching and settlement (348 LOC)_
>
> _PaymentRouter.sol - Handles payments via AP2 protocol (210 LOC)_

The key insight was to keep the blockchain minimal - just the trustless settlement layer. All the AI reasoning happens off-chain for speed and cost efficiency.

By 2 AM, I had all contracts compiling and 27 Foundry tests passing. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing that green checkmark wall.

### Day 2: The Agent Swarm

The real magic happened when I started building the agent coordination layer using **LangGraph**. This framework is perfect for multi-agent systems because it gives you:

- Type-safe state management across agents
- Conditional routing (different paths based on agent decisions)
- Streaming outputs for real-time visualization
- Full observability and debugging

Each agent is built with a consistent pattern:

1. Receive intent + context from shared state
2. Use LLM API (Claude or Gemini) for analysis
3. Return structured output with reasoning and confidence scores
4. Update shared state for next agent

The workflow looks like this:

One of the breakthrough moments was getting the fraud agent working. I gave it examples of wash trading patterns and pump-and-dump schemes, and it started catching suspicious behavior with scary accuracy. In testing, it flagged a fake intent I created where the same address was both buyer and seller.

### Day 3: UI, Integration & Deployment

The final day was all about making it usable. I built a Streamlit dashboard that shows:

- Real-time agent execution with color-coded status (🟡 running → 🟢 complete)
- Live intermediate results from each agent
- Confidence scores and reasoning for every decision
- Transaction links to Arc testnet explorer

The coolest feature: you can watch the agents "think" in real-time. When the Matching Agent analyzes intents, you see its reasoning appear live:

🎯 Matching Agent: "Found 3 potential matches for BUY intent..."

Match #1: score 0.92 - "High compatibility, price within 2% of market"

Match #2: score 0.78 - "Good match but 4% price spread"

...reasoning continues...

### Deployment to Arc Testnet

Getting everything on Arc L1 was surprisingly smooth. Circle's infrastructure is solid - the testnet is fast, the faucet is generous with USDC, and the block explorer is clean.

I used Foundry's deployment scripts:

> _forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \\_
>
> _\--rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \\_
>
> _\--broadcast \\_
>
> _\--legacy_

Within minutes, all three contracts were live and verified. You can actually see them on Arc testnet explorer - real contracts with real code, not vaporware.

The moment when I created the first intent through the UI and saw it appear on the Arc explorer... that's the hackathon high right there.

## Why Arc L1 Was the Perfect Foundation

Here are some benefits with Circle's Arc Chain

### 1. Native USDC Integration

Arc uses USDC as its native gas token. This is brilliant for a DeFi intent system because:

- No need for users to hold separate gas tokens
- All payments are already in USDC
- Seamless integration with traditional finance via AP2

### 2. EVM Compatibility with Modern Features

Arc is EVM-compatible but built from scratch with modern standards. I could use familiar Solidity patterns while leveraging:

- Faster block times (2-second finality)
- Lower gas costs
- Better tooling support

### 3. The Google's AP2 Protocol

Using Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) on Arc Chain is game-changing. It lets you verify off-chain payments (like Stripe) on-chain. In Arc AI Agents, the PaymentRouter contract can:

- Accept traditional credit card payments via Stripe
- Verify the payment happened using Circle's oracle
- Release escrow atomically

This bridges TradFi and DeFi in a way that's actually usable.

### 4. Early Ecosystem Opportunity

Arc is brand new (testnet launched recently). Being an early builder means:

- First-mover advantage in the ecosystem
- Direct feedback from the Arc team
- Potential for future grants/support
- Chance to define standards

## The Numbers: What We Achieved

After 72 hours of focused building, here's what shipped:

**Smart Contracts:**

- 3 production contracts (740 LOC total)
- 27 Foundry tests (100% passing)
- Deployed and verified on Arc testnet

**AI Agents:**

- 5 specialized agents with distinct roles
- LangGraph orchestration with conditional routing
- Real-time streaming outputs
- Structured outputs with confidence scores

**Full Stack:**

- FastAPI backend with async endpoints
- Streamlit UI with live agent visualization
- Arc L1 integration with contract calls
- Real-time transaction tracking

**Performance:**

- Intent matching: 2-5 seconds end-to-end
- Agent reasoning: 1-3 seconds per agent
- On-chain settlement: < 10 seconds (Arc's 2s block time)
- Cost per intent: ~$0.10 (LLM API calls)

## The Architecture: Hybrid Intelligence

The key architectural decision was to keep AI off-chain and settlement on-chain. Here's why this hybrid approach works:

### Off-Chain: AI Coordination Layer

All the "thinking" happens off-chain using LangGraph:

```
Intent → Matching Agent → Market Agent → Fraud Agent → Risk Agent → Settlement Agent → On-Chain Settlement
```

Each agent:

1. Receives shared state (intent data, previous agent outputs)
2. Calls LLM API (Claude or Gemini)
3. Returns structured decision with reasoning
4. Updates state for next agent

This gives us:

- **Speed**: LLM inference in seconds (not minutes)
- **Cost**: $0.05-0.10 per intent (not $10-50 on-chain)
- **Flexibility**: Update prompts without contract upgrades
- **Explainability**: Full reasoning chain visible

### On-Chain: Trustless Settlement

The settlement flow on Arc L1:

1. **Intent Registration**

> _function registerIntent(_
>
> _IntentType intentType,_
>
> _address asset,_
>
> _uint256 price,_
>
> _uint256 quantity_
>
> _) external returns (bytes32 intentId);_

2. **Escrow Creation** (when match found)

> _function createEscrow(_
>
> _bytes32 buyIntentId,_
>
> _bytes32 sellIntentId,_
>
> _uint256 amount_
>
> _) external returns (uint256 escrowId);_

3. **Atomic Settlement**

> _function settleEscrow(uint256 escrowId) external {_
>
> _// Verify both parties deposited_
>
> _// Transfer assets atomically_
>
> _// Emit settlement event_
>
> _}_

### Why This Architecture Scales

**Off-Chain Advantages:**

- LLM inference: 1-5 seconds per agent (vs minutes on-chain)
- Cost: $0.10 per intent (vs $10-50 on-chain computation)
- Flexibility: Update agent prompts without contract upgrades

**On-Chain Advantages:**

- Trustless settlement: No one can rug pull
- Composability: Other contracts can read intent data
- Transparency: All settlements verifiable

The hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds.

## For Builders: Key Takeaways

If you're building at the intersection of AI and blockchain, here's what I learned:

### 1. Use the Right Tool for Each Layer

- **AI Layer**: LangGraph for orchestration, Claude/Gemini for reasoning
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for Python (fast, async, auto-docs)
- **Blockchain Layer**: Foundry for contracts (best testing experience)
- **UI Layer**: Streamlit for MVPs (insanely fast to build)

### 2. Start with the Contract Tests

Write your smart contract tests first. It forces you to think through edge cases and gives you confidence to build the rest of the stack.

### 3. Make AI Decisions Explainable

Always include reasoning and confidence scores in LLM outputs. Users need to understand why the system made a decision, especially in finance.

### 4. Stream Everything

Use server-sent events or WebSockets to stream agent progress to the UI. Real-time feedback makes the experience magical.

### 5. Deploy Early and Often

I deployed to Arc testnet on day 2. Having real on-chain contracts motivated me and caught integration bugs early.

## The Business Case: Why This Could Be Big

## Final Thoughts: Why This Matters

We're at an inflection point in technology. For the first time, we have:

1. **Smart contracts** that can enforce trustless execution
2. **LLMs** that can understand context and reason
3. **Fast L1s like Arc** that can handle real-time settlement
4. **TradFi bridges like AP2** that connect to existing finance

These pieces weren't ready 2 years ago. They are now.

The future of finance isn't purely decentralized (too rigid) or purely centralized (too risky). It's **agentic and hybrid** - AI agents handling intelligent coordination, smart contracts handling trustless settlement, and bridges connecting both worlds.

Arc AI Agents is my bet on that future. I built it in 72 hours to prove it's possible. Now let's build it for real.
