## **Event Overview**

The landscape of digital commerce is undergoing a radical shift, and the builders of tomorrow are leading the charge.

From **January 9–24, 2026**, more than **1,200 participants across 222 teams** came together for the **Agentic Commerce on Arc** hybrid hackathon on [LabLab.ai](https://lablab.ai/). Powered by **Circle, Arc, and NativelyAI**, and supported by **Google, Google DeepMind, and Google AI Studio**, the event challenged developers to build **agentic payment and commerce experiences with USDC on Arc**, where AI agents don't just recommend actions, they coordinate, pay, and settle value onchain in real time.

## **A Vision for Agentic Commerce**

The hackathon was designed to push the boundaries of how AI agents can automate and simplify onchain financial workflows. Leveraging **Arc** as the settlement layer and **USDC** as native gas and value, participants built systems where agents could handle everything from usage-based API payments and escrow to storefront operations with deterministic, sub-second finality.

Builders focused on creating "agentic" experiences where AI interprets user intent, reasons with **Gemini models** via **Google AI Studio** or the Gemini API, and autonomously interacts with Circle infrastructure and Arc smart contracts to execute commerce-driven tasks end to end.

This hybrid **AI hackathon** brought together online and on-site builders who needed to prototype real-world use cases in just two weeks. For many teams, it was their first **artificial intelligence hackathon**, and they used the event to test ideas, ship working products, and learn from other global teams.

## **From Global Visionaries to On-Site Innovators**

The event saw a massive global turnout, featuring both a competitive online track and a high-energy on-site component. On-site participants gathered to collaborate and code, while thousands more joined virtually to redefine the intersection of AI and Web3.

The intensity of the two-week build culminated in a showcase of projects that weren't just prototypes, they were viable businesses. Judges were so impressed by the quality of the submissions that **Google increased their prize pool from $10,000 to $40,000 in GCP Credits** just before the winners were announced, adding five additional "Honorable Mention" slots to recognize more standout teams.
