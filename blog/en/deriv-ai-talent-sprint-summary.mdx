## **A Vision for AI-Driven FinTech**

The hackathon was designed to push the boundaries of what's possible in the FinTech space. Participants were tasked with building production-ready prototypes that could address critical business needs—from AI-powered trading psychologists to autonomous regulatory radar systems.

By leveraging modern LLMs and agentic frameworks, builders created systems that don't just process data but provide actionable reasoning. Whether it was identifying coordinated fraud rings or automating the entire employee lifecycle, the focus was on building "invisible" orchestration layers that drive efficiency and safety in financial operations.
