## Why should I use ChatGPT?

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is an AI-powered solution that has already revolutionized our perception about interaction with AI, and will revolutionize how businesses interact with their customers in 2023. You can see three examples of apps created during our previous AI Hackathons with its previous version, GPT - 3: [kiwi video](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon/slates/kiwi-video), [Book And I](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon/book-ai/book-and-i) or [novela ink](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon/approxteam/novela-ink#video).

With its natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can understand what customers are saying, anticipate their needs, and respond in a more personal and engaging way. It is designed to be more natural and human-like than current AI solutions, so customers can feel like they are having a conversation with a real person. ChatGPT is also designed to be reliable and secure, so businesses can trust that their conversations are safe and private. With its advanced capabilities, ChatGPT will be a great asset for businesses in 2023.
