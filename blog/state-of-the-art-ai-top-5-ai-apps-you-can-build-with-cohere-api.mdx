## Why should you build apps in 2023 with Generative AI?

As we advance into 2023, adopting generative AI for app development proves crucial for businesses of all sizes. Even amid [challenging times](https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023), the AI industry continues its upward trajectory. Generative AI greatly benefits app development by enabling swift and effective creation of complex features, including smart UI, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms. Leveraging generative AI streamlines the product lifecycle, saving time and resources in the long haul, while crafting engaging, user-friendly, and efficient apps that enhance user experience.

Ultimately, generative AI emerges as the optimal choice for app development, providing businesses a competitive advantage and heightened user satisfaction in 2023.

Through a single, user-friendly API, the AI platform Cohere.ai gives developers access to sophisticated Large Language Models and NLP technologies. The variety of models offered by Cohere.ai, including Generate and Classify, make it simple and quick for developers to build unique AI models and incorporate them into their applications. In addition to giving developers access to the most recent AI tools and research, the platform streamlines the process of developing, testing, and deploying AI models.

Utilizing Cohere.ai for your app has a number of benefits, including quicker model building, enhanced accuracy and performance, and better scalability and maintainability. AI models developed using Cohere.ai are simpler to deploy, maintain, and update when necessary. Additionally, Cohere.ai gives developers access to the most recent AI tools and research, enabling them to stay one step ahead of the competition and perhaps surpass it by leveraging the most cutting-edge AI technology.

## Top 5 AI apps using Cohere

### Research Paper Clustering

Winners of [Transformers AI Online Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/transforming-with-transformers) created an amazing [Cohere API](https://lablab.ai/event/transforming-with-transformers/hummingbirds/Research%20Paper%20Clustering) based app to provide an interactive tool for visualizing research papers in a 2D map where the papers are placed on the map based on some vector embedding of the summary. The papers that are similar to each other will cluster together. This will allow researchers to identify papers that have similar concepts and even allow users to look at concepts from different fields that are applicable in their own field.

### Perfect prompt

Winners of the [Cohere AI Hackathon #3](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-ai-hackathon-classify) build in 3 days an outstanding [prompt app](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-ai-hackathon-classify/AP/Perfect%20Prompt), which is a one stop shop for prompt engineering and image generation.Perfect Prompt allows you to experiment with your prompt before submitting it several times to a image generation model. Just type in a prompt, and Perfect Prompt will generate an image as well 10 variations of the input prompt with a given art style. First, Perfect Prompt identifies the art style using cohere classify, and matches it to one of five. Then, this style is added to an internal prompt, which asks cohere generate to create variations of the input prompt. These prompts are then ranked again by the classifier, and only the top ten are returned. The user may use any details from these to create their next prompt, and generate another image!

### TALDERA

Team who has been chosen as the best project during [Cohere Thanksgiving Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-thanksgiving-hackathon) built a [TALDERA](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-thanksgiving-hackathon/CloseAI%20Deceptacons/TALDERA) -  Discord bot that provides an easy-to-read, semantically rich summary of a channel's Discord activity in a particular time range. The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats.

### Baith al suroor

The project, which wowed judges during [Generative AI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/generative-ai-hackathon) used [Cohere API](https://lablab.ai/event/generative-ai-hackathon/phoeniks/Baith%20al%20suroor) to transform your space. With the Cohere language Command model, it can generate descriptions of your desired design, and the Stable Diffusion generative model creates relevant images and transitional videos to bring your vision to your thoughts.

What a brilliant idea to connect different LLMs together to solve a problem and innovate the industry!

Who [watched](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1705132592) on 12th of January 2023 finalist projects pitchings and the winner announcement stream, must have been also mesmerized by what you can build with [Cohere API](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/ratlabs/f). Winning team created a smart Slack bot that implements multilingual semantic search and sentiment analysis to facilitate multi-language messaging platforms by improving the chat search function. The bot allows users to search using any language for messages in any language. It also contains a sentiment analysis that gives moderators a sentiment report on the messages of specific users or the chat as a whole.
