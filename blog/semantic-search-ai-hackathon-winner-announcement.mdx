Although the projects that were submitted were of the highest caliber, there could only be one winner. One Honored Mention, one Winner, and two Finalists were the results of the fierce competition. In order to determine which project stood out from the others, the judges from Lablab.ai and Cohere examined the projects using a variety of criteria, such as:

* Degree of Completion Presentation Style Applicability

In the end, the project that not only met every requirement but also gave a thorough and compelling presentation to show the potential of the team's concept in a fresh and new way was the one that won.To differentiate itself from the competition, the presentation had to be able to grab the judges' attention and convince them of the importance of the proposal.

Also during the winner announcement stream you had an opportunity to know more about other to projects to which we would like to shoutout to:

* [Podsearch](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/info-insighters/podsearh) - Podcasts are an excellent source of knowledge. But they can be too long and hard to pay attention to the entire time. What if there is a more intuitive way to search for podcasts and also for info within podcasts? This is where our product comes into play. It is possible to scrape the documentation and build an index for a search engine using our architecture easily.
* [SemantoTube](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/giga-chads/semantotube) - Our application aims to make it easier for users to find and access the information they need within the specified video. By using the Cohere API, we are able to perform advanced semantic searches that go beyond simple keyword matching, allowing users to find content relevant to their query in the specified video. Our application utilizes the Cohere API to locate and highlight the specific transcript within the video that matches their search. This makes it easier for users to quickly find and access the information they need, without having to manually search through the entire video.
