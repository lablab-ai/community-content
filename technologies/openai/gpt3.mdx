# OpenAI GPT-3

GPT-3 is an autoregressive language model (LLM) from [OpenAI](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT series created by OpenAI. Currently in its open beta phase, GPT-3 has garnered significant attention and acclaim for its unparalleled ability to understand and generate human-like text. With an astounding 175 billion parameters at its disposal, GPT-3 stands as one of the most expansive and powerful language models ever constructed at the time of its release.

GPT-3's exceptional performance is not only limited to its sheer size but also stems from its highly refined architecture. Harnessing the power of deep learning, GPT-3 delivers consistently accurate and relevant results, elevating the standard for language models and establishing itself as a trailblazer in the field of artificial intelligence.
