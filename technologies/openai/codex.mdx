# OpenAI Codex

OpenAI Codex is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It parses natural language and generates code in response. It is used to power GitHub Copilot, a programming autocompletion tool. Codex is a descendant of OpenAI's GPT-3 model, fine-tuned for use in programming applications. OpenAI has released an API for Codex in closed beta. Based on GPT-3, a neural network trained on text, Codex has additionally been trained on 159 gigabytes of Python code from 54 million GitHub repositories.
