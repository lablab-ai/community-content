# OpenAI Whisper

The Whisper models are trained for speech recognition and translation tasks, capable of transcribing speech audio into the text in
the language it is spoken (ASR) as well as translated into English (speech translation). Whisper has been trained on 680,000 hours of
multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. Whisper is Encoder-Decoder model. Input audio is split into 30-second
chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. A decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text
caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps,
multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speech translation.
