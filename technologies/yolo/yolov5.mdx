# YOLO v5
  [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) is a family of object detection architectures and 
  models pretrained on the COCO dataset and created By [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) Team in 2020. This architecture uses single Neural Network to process entire image. It divides image into regions 
  and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.
  YOLOv5 is available in the Hub as a PyTorch module. You can use it directly in your code or in the Hub.
