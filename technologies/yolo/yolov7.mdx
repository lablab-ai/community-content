# YOLO v7
  The YOLOv7 algorithm is a big advancement in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
  It is more accurate and faster than any other object detection models or YOLO versions. It is also 
  much cheaper to train on small datasets without any pre-trained weights. Hence, it's expected 
  to become the industry standard for object detection in the near future.


  The official paper named “YOLOv7: Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for 
  real-time object detectors” was released in July 2022 by Chien-Yao Wang, Alexey Bochkovskiy, and 
  Hong-Yuan Mark Liao. The research paper has become immensely popular in a matter of days. The source code was 
  released as open source under the GPL-3.0 license, a free copyleft license. You can find the code 
  in the official YOLOv7 GitHub repository. The repository was awarded over 4.3k stars in the first 
  month after release. 

  ## What's new in YOLOv7?
  
  Serveral architectural reforms imporved speed and accuraracy in YOLOv7. Compared to the previously 
  most accurate YOLOv6 model (56.8% AP), the YOLOv7 real-time model achieves a 13.7% higher AP (43.1% AP) 
  on the COCO dataset.

  - Architectural Reforms
      - Model Scaling for Concatenation based Models 
      - E-ELAN (Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network)
  - Trainable BoF
      - Planned re-parameterized convolution
      - Coarse for auxiliary and Fine for lead loss

  The paper discusses the YOLOv7 architecture in great detail and provides intuition into how the model works.
