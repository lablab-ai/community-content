# YOLO v6
  YOLOv6 has a series of models for various industrial scenarios, including N/T/S/M/L,
  which the architectures vary considering the model size for better accuracy-speed trade-off.
  And some Bag-of-freebies methods are introduced to further improve the performance,
  such as self-distillation and more training epochs. For industrial deployment,
  we adopt QAT with channel-wise distillation and graph optimization to pursue extreme performance.
  YOLOv6-N hits 35.9% AP on COCO dataset with 1234 FPS on T4. YOLOv6-S strikes 43.5% AP with 495 FPS,
  and the quantized YOLOv6-S model achieves 43.3% AP at a accelerated speed of 869 FPS on T4.
  YOLOv6-T/M/L also have excellent performance, which show higher accuracy than other detectors with the similar inference speed.
