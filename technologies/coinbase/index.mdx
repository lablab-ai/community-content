## x402

x402 is an HTTP-native payment protocol that enables AI agents and applications to make programmatic payments without accounts, credit cards, or manual approvals. Built on EIP-3009, x402 turns the unused HTTP 402 status code into a working payment system that allows autonomous agents to discover, understand pricing, and pay for API access automatically.
