# x402

x402 is a payment protocol that unlocks HTTP 402 Payment Required, turning it into a working payment system for AI agents and applications. The protocol enables programmatic, autonomous payments without requiring accounts, credit cards, or manual human intervention. Built on EIP-3009 (transferWithAuthorization), x402 allows AI agents to discover services, understand pricing, sign payment authorizations, and pay for API access—all automatically through HTTP requests and responses.

The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine payments, making it ideal for AI agents that need to pay for API access, data services, or computational resources. With x402, payments are as simple as an HTTP request: when an agent requests a paid resource, the server responds with HTTP 402 and payment instructions. The agent then signs a payment payload, retries the request with an `X-PAYMENT` header, and receives the resource—all without human intervention.

## Start building with x402

x402 makes payments HTTP-native, enabling AI agents to autonomously discover and pay for services. The protocol supports gasless payments through facilitators, works with any EIP-3009 token (USDC by default), and provides SDKs for popular frameworks like Express and Axios. Whether you're building a paid API service or an AI agent that needs to purchase resources, x402 simplifies the payment flow into standard HTTP requests and responses. Check out the community-built [x402 use cases and applications](/apps/tech/coinbase/x402) to see what others are building.
