# Text Generation Web UI
The Text Generation Web UI is a Gradio-based interface for running Large Language Models like LLaMA, llama.cpp, GPT-J, Pythia, OPT, and GALACTICA. 
It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with these models and generate text, with features such as model switching, notebook mode, chat mode, and more. 
The project aims to become the go-to web UI for text generation and is similar to [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) in terms of functionality.

## Features
* Dropdown menu for switching between models
* Notebook mode that resembles OpenAI's playground
* Chat mode for conversation and role-playing
* Instruct mode compatible with various formats, including Alpaca, Vicuna, Open Assistant, Dolly, Koala, ChatGLM, and MOSS
* Nice HTML output for GPT-4chan
* Markdown output for GALACTICA, including LaTeX rendering
* Custom chat characters
* Advanced chat features (send images, get audio responses with TTS)
* Efficient text streaming
* Parameter presets
* Layers splitting across GPU(s), CPU, and disk
* CPU mode
* and much more!

## Installation
There are different installation methods available, including one-click installers for Windows, Linux, and macOS, as well as manual installation using Conda. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [Text Generation Web UI repository](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).

## Downloading Models
Models should be placed inside the `models` folder. You can download models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads), such as Pythia, OPT, GALACTICA, and GPT-J 6B. Use the `download-model.py` script to automatically download a model from Hugging Face.

## Starting the Web UI
After installing the necessary dependencies and downloading the models, you can start the web UI by running the `server.py` script. The web UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:7860/?__theme=dark`. You can customize the interface and behavior using various command-line flags.

## System Requirements
Check the [wiki]([docs/System-requirements.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki)) for examples of VRAM and RAM usage in both GPU and CPU mode.
