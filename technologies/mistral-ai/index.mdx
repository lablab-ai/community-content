## Introduction

Mistral 7B v0.1 is Mistral AI's first Large Language Model (LLM). A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence algorithm trained on massive amounts of data that is able to generate coherent text and perform various natural language processing tasks.

The raw model weights are downloadable from the [documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/mistralai/).

A Docker image bundling vLLM, a fast Python inference server, with everything required to run our model is provided to quickly spin a completion API on any major cloud provider with NVIDIA GPUs.

### Where to Start?

If you are interested in deploying the Mistral AI LLM on your infrastructure, check out the [Quickstart](https://docs.mistral.ai). If you want to use the API served by a deployed instance, go to the [Interacting with the model page](https://docs.mistral.ai/api) or view the [API specification](https://docs.mistral.ai/api).
