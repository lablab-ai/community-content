# Hackathon Data Access and Usage Guide

Welcome to the hackathon! This guide will help you understand the structure of the data provided, how it is organized, and how to efficiently process it for your projects.

You can request access to the data [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebgLrnxtT6iuWRkNz8meFiecSabQWe2A4PaELrq9LwmgtPag/viewform?usp=sharing)

## Overview of the Data
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of healthcare operations, focusing on member demographics, enrollment details, healthcare services, and provider information. It captures various interconnected aspects of the healthcare system, including patient enrollment in plans, the services they use, and the providers delivering those services. This granular data enables participants to analyze patterns, optimize healthcare costs, and explore equity in service delivery. The dataset is divided into several key components, each offering unique insights into the healthcare journey.

---
### Structure and Size
- **Total Data**:
  - Approximately **450,000 members** with **37.5 million records**, divided into **two states**: Hawaii and California.
- **File Size**:
  - **Compressed ZIP**: ~2 GB.
  - **Uncompressed Parquet Files**: ~3.5 GB.
  - **If converted to CSV**: The total size may grow to ~10 GB.
- **Subfolder Organization**:
  - Each dataset (e.g., Members, Enrollment, Services) is stored in a **subfolder** containing one or more **Parquet files**.
  - Each subfolder also includes two utility scripts:
    - `convert_to_csv.py`: Converts all Parquet files into one CSV file.
    - `truncate_rows.py`: Truncates the dataset to a smaller, manageable size.

# Dataset Relationships

The data consists of several interconnected datasets that provide a comprehensive picture of patient care, member information, and healthcare costs. Here’s how they are related:

## 1. Members and Enrollment
- **Key Relationship**: `PRIMARY_PERSON_KEY`, `MEMBER_ID`
- Each member is identified by a unique key (`PRIMARY_PERSON_KEY` or `MEMBER_ID`).
- These keys link demographic information (age, gender, race, etc.) in the `Members` dataset to the `Enrollment` dataset, providing details about when members started their healthcare plan and how long they have been enrolled.

## 2. Members and Services
- **Key Relationship**: `PRIMARY_PERSON_KEY`, `MEMBER_ID`
- The same unique keys (`PRIMARY_PERSON_KEY` or `MEMBER_ID`) link members from the `Members` dataset to the healthcare services they’ve used, stored in the `Services` dataset. This allows tracing which member received specific medical services (e.g., doctor visits or treatments).

## 3. Services and Providers
- **Key Relationship**: `PROV_KEY`
- The `Services` dataset is connected to the `Providers` dataset using the `PROV_KEY`, which identifies the healthcare providers who delivered the services. Providers could be individual practitioners, clinics, or hospitals, and their information includes type, location, and other attributes.

## 4. Overall Relationship
- The datasets are interconnected in the following way:
  - **Members** → **Enrollment** → **Services** → **Providers**
- These relationships allow for comprehensive analyses of:
  - **Who** are the members receiving care, and what are their demographics?
  - **What** services are being used, and how much do they cost?
  - **Where** are services being delivered, and by which providers?

## How to Work with the Data

### 1. Parquet Files
We recommend working directly with the **Parquet files**, as they are optimized for storage and processing. Here’s an example of how to load and explore a Parquet file:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a single Parquet file
df = pd.read_parquet('path_to_your_file.parquet')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Perform basic operations
print(df.info())
```

### 2. Convert Parquet to CSV
If you prefer working with CSV files, you can use the `convert_to_csv.py` script included in each subfolder.

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to the `Hack_lokahi` folder.
2. Adjust the path if needed.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python convert_to_csv.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Combine all Parquet files in the subfolder into one CSV file.
   - Save the CSV file in the same folder.

---

### 3. Truncate Data for Smaller Files
If the data is too large for your use case, you can truncate it using the `truncate_rows.py` script.

#### Steps:
1. Open the script and set the desired number of rows (`N_ROWS`).
2. Run the script in the desired subfolder (e.g., `Claims_Services`):
   ```bash
   python truncate_rows.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Combine all Parquet files.
   - Create a truncated version (both Parquet and CSV formats) in a new subfolder (e.g., `truncated_Claims_Services`).

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use Parquet Files**: These are efficient for both storage and processing.
2. **Mind the Size**:
   - The uncompressed data is ~2GB, but converting to CSV can increase it to ~10 GB.
   - Use the truncation script for smaller datasets.
3. **Scripts Are Pre-Included**:
   - Each subfolder already includes `convert_to_csv.py` and `truncate_rows.py`.

# Example Potential Applications

## 1. AI-Powered Healthcare Cost Analyzer
- **Objective**: Build an interactive tool to analyze and visualize healthcare costs for patients and providers.
- **Approach**:
