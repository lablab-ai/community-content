# Opus

## What is Opus?

Opus is an enterprise platform for agentic automation that turns plain-language prompts into secure, supervised workflows. It combines AI speed with human oversight so teams can automate high-stakes processes without losing control. 


## Company snapshot

Opus is built by AppliedAI, an Abu Dhabi–based company focused on enterprise AI operations. In February 2025, AppliedAI raised a $55M Series A led by G42, with participation from Palantir, Bessemer Venture Partners, McKinsey, e&, and Accrete Capital.



## The Problem

Most organizations still rely on manual, document-heavy work that’s slow, error-prone, and expensive to outsource. Opus compresses time-to-value by orchestrating AI agents, rules, and reviewers in one place—cutting costs, cycle time, and variance while preserving accountability.

**Opus is built for owners of complex back-office operations where accuracy and auditability are non-negotiable.** 

This includes domains like operations, risk/compliance, and line-of-business teams—especially in healthcare (claims, prior authorization), banking (KYC/AML, regulatory reporting), and insurance (claims, underwriting). Platform, data, and AI teams use Opus to standardize and scale supervised automation across the enterprise.



## What sets Opus apart

Opus layers artificial intelligence with human-supervised guardrails: our **Large Work Model (LWM)** converts prompt-based intentions into executable workflows. 

We also use a **Work Knowledge Graph (WKG)** to improve your generated workflows; your data is only used to make your organization’s future workflows better.

Opus is also building an **Expert Cloud** to provide domain oversight mid-workflow to ensure accuracy in regulated industries. 

These capabilities together help Opus move organizations from ad-hoc scripts to durable, auditable AI workflow automations.

## How Opus works

### Workflows & Jobs

A *workflow* is the design-time blueprint of an automated process on a visual canvas; each workflow doubles as a living model of how work gets done. Teams can sketch, simulate, and refine processes in minutes before rollout—collapsing months of redesign and de-risking change.

A *job* is a runtime instance with a complete audit trail of inputs, outputs, intermediate states, and reviewer decisions. This separation enables scale, safe iteration, and compliance-grade traceability.

**Node-based composition** 

Users on Opus can build processes from modular nodes:

- **Agent Nodes** for LLM-powered tasks and decisions.
- **Review Nodes** for human-in-the-loop supervision or agentic validation with accept/reject/override flows. 
- **Data Nodes** for OCR/extraction and import/export, plus an **External Service** node for integrating your Opus workflow with any REST API.  
- **Execute Workflow** to reuse sub-workflows as modular building blocks across teams. 

---

## Core capabilities

- **Data intake & structuring** — Ingest text, PDFs, images, CSV/JSON, and import data from supported platforms;  
- **Deterministic rules + AI judgment** — Decision nodes automate business rules and evaluation, while Agent nodes handle task completion, data classification/extraction, and reasoning.  
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Built-in checkpoints route low-confidence or high-impact cases to reviewers with clear accept/reject/override actions.  
- **Provenance & auditability** — Every run produces a complete audit log (inputs, fields, rules fired, rationales, timestamps, IDs) for observability.  
- **Policy management & memory controls** — A central policy repository links rules to workflows, detects violations during design and execution, and lets admins balance strict compliance with institutional memory.  
- **Reusability by design** — Sub-workflows and standardized schemas make patterns portable across teams and use cases.

## Example use cases

- **KYC onboarding** — Extract identity fields, check policy rules, route edge cases to review, and generate an auditable decision artifact.  
- **Market & social intelligence** — Monitor sources, dedupe/cluster, score relevance, enforce brand/policy checks, and publish briefs with provenance.  
- **Resume screening** — Parse resumes, match against live job descriptions, threshold to shortlists, and route with a full audit trail.  
- **E-commerce returns adjudication** — Assess item condition against policy and escalate high-value or low-confidence cases.  
- **Sales demo personalization** — Ingest product docs and target-account context to tailor demos, with agentic or human review before delivery.

## Pricing & ROI

Opus uses usage-based pricing measured in “manhours,” a standardized unit of productive output for Human+AI working on the platform. 

This makes cost and value transparent.

---

## For builders and teams

Non-technical users can go from prompt to workflow and refine on the visual canvas. 

Developers can extend with Python in **Opus Code** and call external systems via **External Service** nodes, while data import/export nodes make it easy to move structured records through the flow. The result is a shared surface where business and engineering collaborate with confidence.

---

## Trust & certifications

Opus is built on a Zero-Trust posture with enterprise safeguards: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001/42001, HIPAA alignment for healthcare data, Readiness for EU AI Act obligations  
Full audit logs, runtime monitoring, and SSO support give risk and compliance teams the depth they need to safely automate mission critical workflows.
