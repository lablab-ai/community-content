## What is AudioCraft?
AudioCraft is a next-gen library revolutionizing the audio industry with its array of features. It's not just an audio library, it's the future of audio.

### Key Features:

- **Advanced Audio Generation Models**: With models like AudioGen and MusicGen, prepare to experience unparalleled audio quality.
- **EnCodec**: An innovative audio compressor and tokenizer that is setting a new standard in audio processing.

### Capabilities:
- **Generative Audio Needs**: A comprehensive code base for all generative audio needs - be it music, sound effects, or compression after training on raw audio signals.
- **Simplified Model Design**: The model design, especially for MusicGen and AudioGen, is simplified compared to previous generative models. With a single autoregressive Language Model (LM) that operates on compressed discrete music representation, or tokens, AudioCraft efficiently captures long-term dependencies in audio for high-quality generation.
- **EnCodec**: A unique neural audio codec that converts audio signals to discrete tokens and vice-versa. It acts as the bridge between the raw waveform and the autoregressive language model.
- **Text-to-sound Generation**: With AudioGen, you can convert text into environmental sounds.
- **Text-to-music Generation**: MusicGen brings texts to life by crafting diverse, enchanting melodies based on the provided textual cues.
