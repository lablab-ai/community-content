# Toolhouse

Toolhouse is an advanced platform designed to seamlessly integrate tools and functionalities into Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers a robust cloud infrastructure and an intuitive SDK that empowers developers to equip LLMs with capabilities such as semantic search, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and secure data access with minimal code. Toolhouse bridges the gap between AI models and real-world applications by providing a curated tool store and powerful deployment infrastructure.
