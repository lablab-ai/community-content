## Get Started with Arize
Arize is an ML observability platform that enables practitioners to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain machine learning models in production. It provides real-time monitoring, root cause analysis, and model optimization capabilities.

### Key Capabilities
- *Real-time monitoring*: Track model performance on key metrics like accuracy, latency, drift, and more. Configure alerts and thresholds.
- *Root cause analysis*: Troubleshoot model issues by tracing back to problematic data, code changes, or configuration drift.
- *Model optimization*: Fine-tune models to improve outcomes using tools like bias mitigation, data debugging, and explainability.
- *Model registry*: Catalog models, versions, and performance metadata in a central registry.
- *Notebooks*: Interactively analyze models and data using Python notebooks.
- *Dashboards*: Visualize model and data diagnostics through custom dashboards.
- *Open source options*: Arize open source tools like Phoenix provide free monitoring and experiment tracking.

### Architecture
Arize uses a microservices architecture optimized for scalability. Key components include:

- *Data pipeline*: Pulls real-time inference data from models into the Arize data store.
- *Time series database*: Stores model inference data for analysis.
- *Model registry*: Stores model metadata and versions. Integrates with tools like MLflow.
- *Visualization services*: Generate graphs, charts, and dashboards from stored data.
- *Notebook server*: Provides interactive Python environment for analysis.

### Integrations
Arize integrates with popular ML tools and frameworks:
- *ML frameworks*: PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace
- *MLOps*: Kubeflow, MLflow, Weights & Biases
- *Data infrastructure*: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- *Notebooks*: Jupyter, Colab
