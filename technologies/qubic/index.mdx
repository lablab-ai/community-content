## Introducing Qubic

Sergey Ivancheglo, the visionary creator of Qubic, initiated the project in 2019 as an evolution of decentralized computing concepts. Qubic represents a paradigm shift in how blockchain networks operateâ€”merging the principles of secure transaction validation with meaningful computational work that advances artificial intelligence.

At its core, Qubic introduces a groundbreaking consensus mechanism called Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW), which redirects the computational energy typically wasted in traditional blockchain mining into productive AI model training. This approach addresses a fundamental inefficiency in cryptocurrency networks while simultaneously advancing the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### **Key Highlights of Qubic:**

- **Feeless Transactions:** Qubic offers fast, feeless transactions with instant finality. Users can send and receive funds without paying transaction fees, making it ideal for both everyday and large-scale transfers.

- **Exceptional Speed:** Certified by CertiK with a peak throughput of 15.5 million transactions per second (TPS), making Qubic the fastest verified blockchain network.

- **Instant Finality:** Transactions are secure and final even offline, eliminating the need to wait for block confirmations and providing unmatched reliability.

- **Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW):** Instead of solving arbitrary mathematical puzzles, Qubic's mining process generates billions of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that contribute directly to AI development through the Aigarth system.

- **Energy Efficiency:** By repurposing computational power for AI training, Qubic operates more sustainably than traditional Proof-of-Work systems while maintaining robust network security.

- **Quorum-Based Consensus:** The network uses 676 Computors (validators) where a consensus of at least 451 nodes (two-thirds) must agree on transaction validity, ensuring security and decentralization.

- **Smart Contract IPO Model:** Qubic features an innovative IPO mechanism where smart contracts are divided into 676 shares, distributed via Dutch auctions. Share holders earn passive income from contract fees, promoting fair revenue distribution and enabling anyone to monetize smart contract deployments.

### **Qubic's Consensus Architecture:**

- **Computors:** 676 dedicated validator nodes that execute smart contracts and maintain consensus.

- **AI Miners:** Distributed network of over 100,000 GPU and CPU miners that perform AI training tasks to secure the network while advancing machine learning.

- **Epoch-Based Rewards:** The network generates 1 trillion QUBIC tokens per epoch (7-day cycle), distributed to active Computors and contributors based on their AI training performance and network participation.

### **The Aigarth AI System:**

Aigarth is Qubic's native AI project, a decentralized artificial intelligence system that evolves through the computational work performed by the network's miners. Key features include:

- **Decentralized AGI Development:** Aigarth aims to achieve artificial general intelligence by 2027 through community-driven, decentralized neural network training.

- **Ternary Logic Processing:** Qubic's AI uses ternary logic (-1, 0, +1) instead of traditional binary, enabling more efficient information processing for certain computational tasks.

- **Self-Modifying Networks:** AI networks evolve using fitness scores and asynchronous updates, similar to digital natural selection, without centralized control.

- **Validated Intelligence:** All AI training results are validated through Qubic's quorum consensus mechanism, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

### **Smart Contracts and Economic Innovation:**

- **IPO-Based Deployment:** Every smart contract launched on Qubic is divided into 676 shares, distributed through Dutch auction IPOs, democratizing contract ownership.

- **Passive Income:** Share holders receive ongoing revenue from contract execution fees, creating a passive income opportunity for network participants.

- **Deflation Mechanism:** Smart contract fees burn QUBIC tokens, reducing circulating supply while distributing revenue to contract shareholders.

- **Transparent Revenue Model:** Unlike traditional platforms where developers capture all fees, Qubic's model ensures fair, decentralized revenue distribution.

### **Qubic's Ecosystem and Integration:**

- **Open-Source Development:** Qubic provides comprehensive developer tools, including SDKs in Java, TypeScript, Go, C#, and HTTP-based libraries.

- **Developer Support:** The platform offers a Grants Program to foster high-quality smart contract development and a Bug Bounty Program for community security contributions.

- **Community Governance:** Decisions are made through quorum-based voting, ensuring decentralized control and community involvement.

- **Wallet Integration:** Multiple wallet solutions available, including official Qubic wallets supporting various platforms and use cases.

### **Responsibility and Decentralization:**

- **No Single Entity Control:** The decentralized nature of Qubic ensures no single entity can control or manipulate the network, fostering trust among participants.

- **Transparent Validation:** All AI training tasks and results are recorded on the blockchain, making the system fully auditable and transparent.

- **Community-Driven Development:** With over 630,000 community members and 100,000+ miners, Qubic is governed by its participants rather than a central organization.

### **Availability and Access:**

- **Mainnet Status:** Fully operational since April 2022 with continuous feature development.

- **Official Resources:** Access documentation, tools, and support at the official Qubic platform.

- **Mining Participation:** Join over 100,000 AI miners in the network by dedicating GPU/CPU resources to AI training while earning QUBIC rewards.

- **Smart Contract Development:** Developers can deploy contracts, participate in IPOs, and earn passive income from smart contract fees.
