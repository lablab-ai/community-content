# Tonic Validate - Automated Evaluation for RAG Systems

In the world of generative AI, there’s a fascinating player called Tonic.ai. Think of them as the “Fake Data Company” with a mission to unblock data access, supercharge development, and respect data privacy. Let’s dive into the details of this remarkable technology.

Tonic.ai is on a mission to enable generative AI developers and protect customer privacy. They are experts in LLMOps and have built two powerful products to make the lives of AI developers easier:

Tonic Textual is a modern synthetic data platform for unstructured data, engineered for complex handling of free-text data, PDFs, and Word Documents. It integrates into data and ML pipelines via SDK, using generalized custom models to detect and redact sensitive data from 25+ entity types. Textual's generators refill redacted parts with contextually relevant synthetic data, ensuring data privacy while maintaining data utility for model training, LLMOps, QA testing, and secure document sharing. Textual safeguards your data from breach, exfiltration, and model memorization and is an important asset for responsible AI development and data stewardship.

Tonic Validate accelerates development of RAG systems by providing a platform for automated, rigorous evaluation. It provides 20+ out-of-the-box metrics for measuring the performance of each component in your RAG system, visualizations for comparing performance across time as the system changes, and workflows for creating benchmark responses and reviewing LLM responses with retrieved context. Validate allows you to monitor how your RAG system is truly performing, enabling continuous performance monitoring of your production RAG systems. Understand how code changes impact your system's performance and get the insights you need to build the highest quality experience for your end users.

## Key Features and Benefits

**Best-in-Class NER: Tonic.ai's proprietary NER models have been trained on diverse corpus of text data spanning domains and formats, providing you with the most advanced, best-performing NER models to recognize and redact sensitive information from your unstructured free-text data.

**Advanced RAG Evaluation: Rigorously evaluate every component of your RAG system with just a few lines of code to help you understand where your RAG system is underperforming. Avoid costly decreases in performance by integrating Tonic Validate into your CI/CD processes.

**Understand RAG System Performance: Easily visualize changes in your RAG system performance over time, across RAG system components, individual questions, and question domains.

**Secure Synthetic Data:** Tonic.ai generates secure and scalable synthetic data precisely when and where you need it. Whether you’re creating embeddings for your vector database or preparing data for model tine-tuning, Tonic.ai ensures data privacy without compromising efficiency.

**Local Development Unblock:** Rapid access to realistic, desensitized data during local development accelerates the development process. Tonic.ai ensures that developers work with data that closely resembles production, streamlining their workflows while still respecting customer privacy.

**Compliance Without Dysfunction:** Regulatory compliance is essential, but it shouldn’t hinder developer productivity. Tonic.ai strikes the right balance, allowing organizations to leverage synthetic data to meet compliance requirements seamlessly.

**Trusted by Engineering Teams:** Tonic.ai has earned the trust of engineering teams worldwide. Companies like eBay and Everlywell have witnessed faster release cycles, saved development hours, and improved onboarding thanks to Tonic.ai.
