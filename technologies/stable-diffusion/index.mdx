title: "Stable Diffusion models, tutorials and boilerplates" 
description: "Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating stylized and photo-realistic images. It is pre-trained on a subset of of the LAION-5B dataset and the model can be run at home on a consumer grade graphics card so everyone can create stunning art within seconds."

# Stable Diffusion

Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are a type of image generation technique that work by iteratively "de-noising"
data in a latent representation space, and then decoding the representation into a full image. This is in contrast
to other popular image synthesis methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the auto-regressive technique
used by DALL-E. The Stable Diffusion model is created by a collaboration between engineers and researchers from CompVis,
Stability AI, and LAION and released under
a [Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license), wich means that
it can be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The release of this file is the culmination of many hours
of collective effort to compress the visual information of humanity into a few gigabytes. Furthermore, the model
also supports image-to-image style transfer, as well as upscaling and generating an images from a simple sketch.
Included is also an AI-based Safty Classifier, which understands concepts and other factors in generations to
remove outputs that may not be desired by the model user.
