# Add BNAI Technology to lablab.ai Technology Catalog

This pull request adds the Brain Neural AI (BNAI) technology to the lablab.ai technology catalog. BNAI is an innovative framework for the complete cloning of Artificial Intelligence models, developed by Francesco Bulla & Stephanie Ewelu.

## Key Features Added

- Comprehensive documentation of BNAI's "digital DNA" extraction capabilities
- Detailed explanation of the BNAI parameter system for quantifying AI behavior
- Information about the neural network architecture used for model cloning
- Technical specifications including formulas, parameters, and implementation details

## Technology Highlights

BNAI offers a revolutionary approach to AI model cloning by extracting behavioral characteristics through its comprehensive parameter system and then replicating these characteristics in new models. The technology enables developers to quantify various aspects of AI behavior and clone them with high fidelity.

## Resources Included

- GitHub repository links
- Documentation references
- Technical specifications and formulas
- Parameter descriptions and ranges

This addition will help lablab.ai users discover and build with this cutting-edge AI cloning technology.
