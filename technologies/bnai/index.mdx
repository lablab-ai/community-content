# BNAI

BNAI (Brain Neural AI) is an innovative framework for the complete cloning of Artificial Intelligence models. It extracts the "digital DNA" (BNAI profile) of an original AI model and trains a neural network (BNAI HyperNetwork) that generates a clone with an identical or very similar profile.

## Objectives

- **Digital DNA Extraction:** Calculate and normalize BNAI parameters of an AI model
- **Cloning:** Train a neural network to faithfully replicate the BNAI profile
- **Validation:** Use tests and benchmarks to verify the clone's fidelity
